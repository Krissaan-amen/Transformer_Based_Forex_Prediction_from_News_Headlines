EURUSD is turning slightly higher after a negative open today, holding above 1.0800. EURUSD has rallied some 70-odd pips from its Asian session lows as the 1.0800 level remains pivotal. Where to next for EURUSD? The Euro remains at the back foot at the start of the week and extends Friday's 0.60% drop, which also formed a bearish engulfing pattern on daily chart. Economists at ING had called for EUR/USD to break 1.10 this week. This is still a possibility, but the surprise oil production cut announced by OPEC+ gives Dollar a lifeline. The short-term oscillators currently suggest that bullish forces are waning. Specifically, the MACD histogram is softening but remains above both zero and its red signal line, while the RSI is pointing downwards in the positive territory. In the opinion of Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang and Senior FX Strategist Peter Chia, further losses could drag EUR/USD back to the mid-1.0700s in the near term. Foreign exchange analysts at ING have had a bullish stance on the Euro to dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate for some time with the dollar only able to secure limited corrective recoveries. The single currency starts the new trading week on the defensive and drags EUR/USD back below the 1.0800 mark, or 5-day lows. It is a busy day for the EUR/USD. Following softer inflation numbers for March, manufacturing PMIs from the euro area and the US will draw interest. Looking at the 4-hours chart, the pair tested the 1.0920 zone. A high was formed near 1.0922 before the pair started a downside correction. EUR/USD takes offers to renew intraday low around 1.0790 as it extends the previous U-turn from a short-term key hurdle during early Monday. Adding strength to the downside bias is the clear break of a two-week-old support line, now resistance, as well as the receding bullish bias of the MACD. EUR/USD pares gains made in the last two consecutive weeks around 1.0800 as traders brace for the all-important US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) during early Monday. Adding strength to the pullback moves could be the recent fears of escalating pressure on prices and downbeat Eurozone inflation numbers versus firmer prints of the Federal Reserve's (Fed) favorite inflation gauge.",1.09123,1.09716,1.08839,1.09123,1

Despite concerns over economic growth and oil prices, the EUR/USD is expected to continue to climb over the near-term.

EUR/USD open to a push towards 1.1250 as ECB sticks to its guns – Credit Suisse By RoboForex Analytical Department The EUR/USD pair is trading close to the 1.0900 level on the first Tuesday of April. The market is taking into consideration the latest data on the Core PCE index, which grew by only 0.3% m/m in February, lower than the expected figures. EUR/USD climbs to new multi-week highs near 1.0940 and deflates afterwards following a late bounce in the dollar. The Euro has initially shot higher during the trading session on Tuesday, to break above the 1.09 level. That being said, we are seeing pushback rather quickly. Welcome to Technical Tuesday, a weekly report where we highlight some of the most interesting markets that will hopefully appease technical analysts and traders alike. EUR/USD extends gains through the low 1.09 area. Economists at Scotiabank expect the pair to retest the early 2023 peak at 1.1030. EUR/USD recovered from 1.0788 but ran into resistance in the familiar 1.09 area. The pair must surpass 1.0930 to enjoy further gains, economists at Société Générale report. EUR/USD retreated slightly after having climbed above 1.0900 on Monday. A sustained break above 1.0930 would clear the way toward 1.1030, economists at OCBC Bank report. Fresh acceleration higher is probing through pivotal barrier at 1.0930 (Mar 23 spike high) after three-day consolidation and signaling that the euro holds firm tone. EUR/USD remains well supported and not far off recent highs at 1.0900/0930. Economists at ING expect the pair to extend its race higher throughout the rest of 2023. The EUR/USD pair is trading close to the 1.0900 level on the first Tuesday of April. The market is taking into consideration the latest data on the Core PCE index, which grew by only 0.3% m/m in February, lower than the expected figures. The optimism around the European currency – and the risk complex in general – appears well and sound and now lifts EUR/USD to multi-week highs around 1.0940 on Tuesday. EUR/USD continues its battle with the 1.09 level which may be pierced in due course ahead of a US data filled week. Further gains appear on the cards once EUR/USD surpasses the 1.0930 level, suggest UOB Group's Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang and Senior FX Strategist Peter Chia. EUR/USD makes rounds to 1.0890-85 as the bulls take a breather amid a light calendar, as well as mildly offbeat sentiment, during early Tuesday. The Euro pair's latest retreat could also be linked to the rebound in the US Treasury bond yields, which in turn allow the US Dollar to pare the week-start fall ahead of second-tier data. It is a relatively busy day for the EUR/USD. The German economy and the ECB will be in focus ahead of US JOLTs job openings and factory orders. EURUSD was last seen flat at 1.0894, having gained more than 0.5% on Monday but meeting resistance as the bulls start to move out. The sluggish U.S. economic data weighed on the greenback on Monday which enabled the euro to rally strongly. EUR/USD holds onto the week-start strength as bulls approach the all-important 1.0930 resistance, around 1.0910 by the press time of early Tuesday.",1.09601,1.09692,1.09054,1.09601,0

The major currency pair has attempted a recovery after falling to near 1.0900 as the tight United States labor market has cooled down further after US Employment data released by Automatic Data Processing (ADP) missed estimates. Weaker US private sector jobs data suggests that the Federal Reserve may not need to raise rates much further, potentially bullish for the Euro. U.S. dollar is moving higher despite the strong pullback in Treasury yields. The EUR/USD corrected to the 1.0900 zone after the beginning of the American session and despite weaker-than-expected US economic data. The US Dollar gained momentum, pushing the pair to the downside. The single currency was lifted by weaker than expected US JOLTS job openings data on Tuesday, with today's release of US ADP report, which showed that hiring in the private sector fell significantly in March (Mar 145K vs 200K f/c and Feb upwardly revised to 261K), adding to signals that US labor market is cooling. EUR/USD alternates gains with losses around the 1.0950 region on Wednesday. Foreign exchange analysts at MUFG note that 2-year yield spreads, a key determinant of currency moves have moved against the US dollar and in favour of the Euro. The Euro has initially tried to rally during the trading session on Wednesday but continues to see a lot of significant resistance just above. EUR/USD advanced to its strongest level since early February above 1.0970. Economists at MUFG Bank expect the pair to move back toward the middle of that 1.1000-1.1500 range. EUR/USD faces some selling pressure after another test of the multi-week tops near 1.0970 on Wednesday. EUR/USD is stuck in a tight trading range today as the Euro consolidates its recent strong performance against the US dollar. A fresh multi-month EUR/USD high is within touching distance. EUR/USD holds in narrow range above low 1.09 zone. Economists at Scotiabank expect the pair to resume its race higher on a break above 1.0965/70. Wednesday's US economic docket features the release of the ADP report on private-sector employment for March, due at 12:15 GMT. Estimates point to an addition of 200K private-sector jobs during the reported month, down from 245K in February. The buying interest around the European currency remains well and sound and motivates EUR/USD to edge a tad higher and flirt with the 1.0980 region on Wednesday. The Euro US Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate ticked higher on Tuesday, despite weakening inflation expectations across the Eurozone and consequently, diminished rate hike expectations. Denting morale for the US Dollar (USD) were fears of a recession as manufacturing activity and factory orders fell in the world's largest economy. The Dollar will once again be driving EUR/USD. The pair could surge above 1.1000, but may find it difficult to enjoy further gains, economists at ING report. EUR/USD is continuously trading sideways around 1.0960 following the footprints of the US Dollar Index (DXY). The major currency pair is struggling to find a decisive move as investors are likely to show interest after the release of the United States Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Employment and ISM Services PMI data. It is a busy day for the EUR/USD. While euro area economic indicators will draw interest, the ISM Non-manufacturing PMI and ADP figures will be the key. EUR/USD remains mildly bid around 1.0960-65 as it portrays a three-day uptrend during early Wednesday in Europe. In doing so, the Euro pair justifies the latest growth optimism from Germany and Eurozone while also portraying the cautious mood ahead of the key US activity and employment numbers for March. Despite the tweezer top, we have seen two consecutive days of rally and we are on the third day of bullñsi price action in EUR/USD. The price has rallied into the 1.0970s and is showing little signs of slowing down with the 1.1030/50s eyed for the near future.",1.09033,1.09302,1.08855,1.09033,1

The major currency pair witnessed a volatile Thursday amid the initial US Dollar rebound on recession woes before ending the day unchanged with downbeat US data contrasting with firmer statistics from the Eurozone. EUR/USD struggles to test the yearly high (1.1033) as it fails to extend the series of higher highs and lows from the start of the week, and the US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report may drag on the exchange rate as the update is anticipated to show another rise in employment. EUR/USD is topping the extreme of the day in late New York in holiday calmness. The pair is currently trading at 1.0930 at hourly resistance. Overall picture remains bullish as the single currency benefited from weaker dollar, after downbeat US data pointed to cooling labor market and growing fears of recession risk, with immediate bullish bias to remain intact as long as the price stays above rising 10DMA (1.0865). Treasury yields tested multi-month lows, which was bearish for the American currency. The EUR/USD was unable to get to the 1.10 handle earlier this week, falling just 30 pips short of that level before easing back to below 1.0900 in the early European trade on Thursday. However, I reckon it is a matter of time before the EUR/USD breaks that barrier. EUR/USD drifts but underlying support from narrower spreads remains intact, Shaun Osborne, Chief FX Strategist at Scotiabank, reports. EUR/USD trades without a clear direction around the 1.0900 region on Thursday. The euro was rather quiet during the Thursday session, as markets look likely to continue consolidating. Economists at Credit Suisse look for EUR/USD to eventually see a clear and sustained break above its downtrend from May 2021 and 50% retracement of the 2021/2022 bear trend for strength back to the 1.1035 YTD high, then resistance at 1.1185/1.1275. EUR/USD failed to reach the 1.1000 level yesterday before a resurgent dollar saw the pair retreat to daily support around the 1.0900 handle. Where to next for EURUSD? If the FX market considers the world to be more uncertain it mainly sees EUR-negative risks, Ulrich Leuchtmann, Head of FX and Commodity Research at Commerzbank, reports. EUR/USD reversed quite sharply from a high of 1.0970 yesterday. The first run at 1.10 failure reinforces ING's forecast over this next quarter.

Therefore, Ulrich Leuchtmann, Head of FX and Commodity Research at Commerzbank, is sceptical about current EUR/USD levels. The single currency alternates gains with losses amidst a narrow trading range vs. the dollar and motivates EUR/USD to keep business near the 1.0900 region on Thursday. EUR/USD prints mild losses around 1.0890 during the two-day downtrend heading into Thursday's European session. In doing so, the Euro pair extends the previous day's pullback from a two-month high after confirming a bearish “Head and Shoulders” (H&S) chart pattern on the hourly play. EURUSD under the bearish pressure after the price reversed down from the key resistance area located between the long-term resistance level 1.0950 (which has been reversing the price from the end of April) and the upper daily Bollinger Band. The EUR/USD was under pressure this morning on recessionary fears. However, a jump in German industrial production should support a run at $1.10. EUR/USD holds lower ground near the intraday bottom of 1.0884 as it prints two-day downtrend, after reversing from the highest levels since early February on Tuesday.

The major currency pair didn't show a decisive action despite mixed responses from Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers over the interest rate guidance. The EUR/USD began the week sideways, clinging to the 1.0800 mark amidst a slightly upbeat market sentiment sponsored by an improvement in US ceiling discussions, despite hawkish rhetoric by Federal Reserve's (Fed) officials. At the time of writing, the EUR/USD is trading at 1.0804, almost flat, after hitting a daily low of 1.0795. The market action is choppy as traders are waiting for the news on debt ceiling negotiations. Lagarde's hawkish stance, central bank speeches, and Fed minutes drive a bullish EUR/USD outlook. In the US, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized that stresses in the banking system would likely keep the Fed from raising interest rates as much as would otherwise be necessary. In a panel discussion with former Fed Chair Bernanke, Powell noted that the Fed has “…come a long way in policy tightening and the stance of policy is restrictive and we face uncertainty about the lagged effects of our tightening so far and about the extent of credit tightening from recent banking stresses. Economists at Barclays Bank suggest a complex forecast for the US dollar, considering factors like the potential resolution of the US debt ceiling issue, unexpected softening of Chinese data, and the strength in recent US data. The euro has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, as the market continues to see a lot of noisy behavior going forward. Ulrich Leuchtmann, Head of FX and Commodity Research at Commerzbank, analyzes EUR/USD outlook. EUR/USD adds to Friday's move higher and surpasses the 1.0800 hurdle with some conviction. The Euro extends bounce from temporary base at 1.0760 into second straight day, after failing to register a clear break below daily cloud (spanned between 1.0796 and 1.0875). Fresh strength was sparked by weaker dollar and oversold conditions on daily chart, which prompted a partial profit-taking. Ongoing US debt ceiling talks continue to steer a range of US-pairs, while Euro traders will need to be aware of tomorrow's flash PMI releases EUR/USD has been moved almost entirely by the Dollar in the past week or so, as debt-ceiling news dominated. Economists at ING analyze the pair's outlook for this week. US President Biden has returned to the US from the G7 meetings in Japan and will now be engaged in negotiations with the congressional Republicans in an attempt to secure a deal to raise the debt-ceiling. The single currency alternates gains with losses vs. the greenback and motivates EUR/USD to hover around the 1.0800 neighbourhood at the beginning of the week. US Treasuries and German Bunds parted ways on Friday after a joint 10 bps surge the day before. Yields in the US still rose between 1.3-4.8 bps with the belly underperforming. EURUSD has been stuck in a clear downtrend after peaking at the 13-month high of 1.1094 in late April. In addition, the pair has sliced through crucial technical levels such as the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and the ascending trendline that connected its higher lows since September 2022. EUR/USD extends pullback from intraday high as it drops to 1.0810 heading into Monday's European session. That said, the Euro pair's latest rebound could be linked to the cautious optimism surrounding the US-China ties, as well as hopes of witnessing no US default. UOB Group's Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang and Senior FX Strategist Peter Chia noted that the likelihood of a move to 1.0750 in EUR/USD appears to be losing momentum. The Euro started a major decline from well above 1.1050 against the US Dollar. EUR/USD traded below the 1.0920 support to move into a bearish zone. It is a busy Monday for the EUR/USD. ECB and Fed chatter will influence ahead Eurozone consumer confidence numbers. EUR/USD bulls keep the reins around the intraday high surrounding 1.0825-30 as buyers cheer the upside break of the 100-DMA during Monday's Asian session.

EURUSD switched to recovery mode after its bearish wave from a one-year high stabilized around a two-month low of 1.0700 on Friday. Interestingly, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement zone of the previous bullish run cemented that floor.

EUR/USD shifted gears after printing a weekly low of 1.0635, climbs bolstered by dovish US Federal Reserve (Fed) officials' comments, alongside soft economic data from the United States (US). Therefore, investors looking towards a less hawkish Fed dumped the US Dollar (US) in favor of riskier assets. Traders expect that Fed will leave the federal funds rate unchanged at the next meeting, which is bearish for the American currency. The recent drop in inflation rates in Germany, France, and Spain have triggered speculation about a softer eurozone flash CPI figure, suggests Chris Turner, Global Head of Markets and Regional Head of Research for UK & CEE at ING Bank.

Consensus estimates point to an addition of 170K private-sector jobs during the reported month, down sharply from the 296K in April. Subdued inflation eases ECB pressure, impacting EUR/USD, while debt ceiling bill approval may modestly support the dollar. Euro Area inflation fell across the board in May with both the core and YoY print beating forecasts. Despite the positive data, it is unlikely to deter the ECB from hiking rates at its upcoming meeting. EUR/USD alternates gains with losses below the 1.0700 hurdle following Wednesday's bounce off multi-week lows near 1.0630 on Thursday. The Euro remains at the back foot in early Thursday despite Wednesday's strong downside rejection and signal of bear-trap formation on daily chart, as well as constructive signals from daily chart (fading bearish momentum/north-heading stochastic / RSI approaching oversold territory).

Today, the EUR/USD chart shows that the market is forming a rebound from this support, which has been in place since mid-June. ING notes; “The pair is not just exposed to Chinese sentiment via the risk-environment channel, but more directly given the eurozone's economic exposure to China. The question now remains: will the Chinese story catch up with the euro? It's a rally-and-reverse kind of day for the U.S. dollar, so I'm looking at this potential Fib bounce on EUR/USD. EUR/USD continues to trade in very narrow ranges. Economists at ING analyze the pair's outlook. In the view of Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang and Senior FX Strategist Peter Chia at UOB Group, the downward momentum in EUR/USD appears to be dwindling.

The Euro declined below the 1.0910 support zone to enter a bearish zone against the US Dollar as mentioned in the previous analysis. EURUSD came down as expected to a new low after wave 4 corrective rise so price is now seen in wave back, back at 1.0830 support.

Both the US and the wider Eurozone area will see updates to Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) figures on Tuesday, with high-tier US data due in the back half of the trading week as rate-hungry markets continue to froth for rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve (Fed). It's been a strong start to Q2 for the U.S. Dollar, and that comes along with a few notable items. In direct relation, that USD strength has helped to push EUR/USD down to range support in a mean-reverting backdrop that's been in-place for more than 15 months now. U.S. dollar stabilized near multi-month highs as traders remained focused on the recent changes in Fed policy outlook. Euro bears remain in control on Monday, as the pair wavers without a clear direction, with upside attempts capped below 1.0700. This is a previous support turned resistance and keeps the five-months low, 1.0610 at a dangerously close distance. The Euro's sharp slide has relaxed a little but there are still few if any reasons to back the single currency over the greenback The euro has gone back and forth over the course of the last 12 hours or so, but it looks as if we see a lot of downward pressure, but not in a panic. The most significant event of the week is expected to take place on Thursday with the preliminary release of US GDP for the first quarter. The US economy expanded at an annualized rate of 3.4% in the previous quarter. Should downside pressures persist, the pair might revisit its recent five-month low of 1.0600. Sliding beneath that floor, the price could test the October-November support of 1.0516. Anticipation builds in forex markets as major U.S. economic releases approach, likely influencing DXY dynamics this week. EUR/USD continues to trade within a contained box-like range, up a marginal tenth of a percentage point in the 1.0660s on Monday.  Net-long exposure to the US dollar against futures markets on the CME exchange rose got a fifth week, up US $7.7 billion for the week. The realisation that the Fed are in no position to cut took its time to filter through to Fed fund futures, but we can see here that futures traders got the memo over a month ago with increasingly bullish bets.

At the time, RSI on the daily chart had flared into overbought territory, and this isn't a very common occurrence as the last instance of such showed just before the currency had topped in Q4 of last year. During Tuesday's North American session, the Euro appreciated against the US Dollar, up by more than 0.40%, and exchanged hands above a key resistance level. Softer than expected, US economic data weighed on the Greenback, which trades with losses against most G8 currencies. The weaker-than-expected PMI data put pressure on the American currency. It has been a risk-on session so far, with equity indices rising sharply for the second consecutive day ahead of Tesla's earnings tonight and other big tech companies reporting this week. Also on the rise today have been markets such as crude oil, the EUR/USD and even the GBP/USD. EUR/USD received a much needed reprieve from USD dominance after flash PMI data for April highlighted potential concerns for the US. EUR/GBP surrenders recent gains The EUR/USD continues to see a lot of sluggish behavior, as both central banks are likely to loosen monetary policy later this year. The FTSE has risen to a fresh record high, boosted by weakness in the pound and hopes that the Bank of England will soon start cutting interest rates. With market uncertainty prevailing, the DXY maintains stability above $106, attracting attention from traders anticipating potential upward movements EUR/USD extends its holding pattern of the last few days, trading in the mid 1.0600s on Tuesday, prior to the release of potentially market-moving purchasing manager survey data.  EUR/USD remains lackluster during the Asian trading hours on Tuesday, hovering near 1.0650. From a technical perspective, analysis suggests a bearish sentiment for the pair as it struggles below the pullback resistance at the 1.0695 level. Traders remain obsessed with central bank policies, and quite rightly so. Expectations of Fed policy has dominated sentiment for quite some time, but over the past week or two we're getting stronger signals that key central banks are willing to step out of the Fed's shadows and begin easing before the Fed. The Euro extended losses and traded below the 1.0650 support against the US Dollar. EUR/USD tested the 1.0600 zone and recently started a consolidation phase.",1.07044,1.07158,1.06792,1.07044,0

However, the EUR/USD stands below the 1.0700 threshold posting minimal gains of 0.01%. The Euro has been buffeted over the last few sessions against the US dollar, while EUR/GBP has jumped on recent Sterling weakness. EUR/USD trades in an ascending channel after failing to test the November low (1.0517), but a bear-flag formation may unfold if the exchange rate fails to hold above the monthly low (1.0601). USD/JPY has finally managed to settle above the key 155.00 level. EUR/USD is still bounded in range trading above 1.0601 and intraday bias remains neutral. Strong resistance should be seen from 1.0723 to complete the corrective rise from 1.0601. The euro pulled back from the crucial 1.07 level, an area that has been important more than once at this point. The US dollar advanced in the first half of Wednesday's session, as the likes of the pound and euro gave back some of the PMI-related gains made in the previous session. However, the Aussie dollar was still holding onto its overnight gains after an unexpected increase in inflation data led to a hawkish reassessment of Aussie interest rates. EUR/USD trades just shy of 1.0700 on Wednesday after weaker-than-expected private sector growth and US business activity dent the myth of US economic exceptionalism, weighing on the US Dollar (USD). As the DXY falls below 106, significant shifts in EUR/USD and GBP/USD loom, impacted by recent PMI data and upcoming economic reports. Outlook in EUR/USD is unchanged and intraday bias stays neutral first. Strong resistance should be seen from 1.0723 to complete the corrective rise from 1.0601.

On Thursday, the Euro rose against the US Dollar after US economic data portrayed the economy as weaker than expected. At the same time, the inflation figure prompted investors to price out the Federal Reserve's rate cuts in 2024. USD/JPY tested multi-decade highs as the rally continued. Euro is trading higher for a second consecutive week with EUR/USD building on a rebound off downtrend support. The focus is on this recovery towards trend resistance and the recent rally may be vulnerable into major event risk over the next few days. The euro has been slightly positive recently, but at this point in time it is obvious that there are a lot of sellers above, and therefore it is likely to see a lot of volatility. The EUR/USD is pushing higher after a flat finish yesterday as investors digest stronger-than-expected German consumer confidence and look ahead nervously to US GDP data later today. EUR/USD sherpa-treks higher on Thursday, with a foothold now above 1.0700 as it continues its labored recovery from the 1.0601 April lows. Recent mixed US data has tarnished the image of the US economy, undermining the supremacy of the US Dollar (USD), whilst the Euro (EUR) holds firm on strong services-sector data. Anticipation builds around the ECB's latest economic insights and U.S. GDP data, poised to dictate the next moves for EUR/USD and GBP/USD. EUR/USD recovers its recent losses registered in the previous session, trading around 1.0710 during the Asian session on Thursday. From a technical standpoint, analysis suggests a weakening of bearish sentiment for the pair as it has surpassed the major level of 1.0695 and the psychological level of 1.0700.

Investors broadly expect US rates to hold steady this week, but traders will be looking for an uptick in Fed guidance for when rate cuts could be coming. This article explores the fundamental and the technical outlook for the U.S. dollar, zeroing in on three popular and very liquid pairs: EUR/USD, GBP/USD and USD/CAD. USD/JPY is losing ground amid likely interventions from the BoJ. May has historically been the second-worst month for EUR/USD (-0.62%) and GBP/USD (-0.37%) - see what to watch for from the other major currency pairs! The US calendar might send some important messages this week, particularly on Wednesday when the Fed announces its rate decision. Although changes in interest rates are not on the agenda this week, it would be interesting to see if the central bank will raise the possibility of a rate hike again after the latest inflation setbacks and some hawkish comments from policymakers. The euro continues to see a lot of noise, as we are hanging about the same general area we have been in for some time. This shows just how undecided we are at the moment. The EUR/USD pair struggles to sustain above the round-level resistance of 1.0700 in Monday's European session. The major currency pair exhibits caution ahead of the release of key economic indicators in the Eurozone, such as preliminary Eurozone Q1 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for April, which will be published on Tuesday. EURUSD came under severe selling pressure in the aftermath of a hotter-than-expected inflation report on April 10, posting a fresh 2024 low of 1.0600. Although the pair has been regaining ground since then, the momentum indicators are still tilted to the downside. Technical analysis shows the Dollar Index at pivotal levels, signaling potential buying opportunities if support holds at $105.52. EUR/USD recovers its recent losses registered in the previous session, trading around 1.0720 during the Asian session on Monday. From a technical perspective, analysis indicates a weakening bearish sentiment for the pair as it continues to advance within the descending channel, breaching the key psychological level of 1.0700. Looking at the 4-hour chart, the pair traded as low as 1.0598 and recently started a recovery wave. There was a move above the 1.0650 and 1.0680 resistance levels.

EUR/USD gives back the advance from the start of the week as the US Employment Cost Index (ECI) shows a pickup in wage growth, and the exchange rate may struggle to retain the advance from the monthly low (1.0601) should a bear-flag formation unfold. The disappointing CB Consumer Confidence report did not put pressure on the American currency. The FOMC continues to see a lot of influence on this pair, as the world waits for the announcement on Wednesday, and of course the press conference. The EUR/USD rebounded on the back of this morning's Eurozone data dump. It looks like Southern Europe in particular has survived the macro headwinds of high inflation and restrictive monetary policy relatively well, helping to fuel a 0.3% rise in Eurozone GDP in the first three months of the year. Since its December 2023 high of 1.1140, the EUR/USD has traded lower in the past four months with an accumulated decline of -4.8% (-538 pips) and looks set to end this month of April with a negative footing, potentially a lower monthly closing level (traded at 1.0697 at this time of the writing below last month, March monthly closed level of 1.0790). EUR/USD bounces back strongly from below 1.0700 in Tuesday's European session as the Eurozone preliminary inflation data for April and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for the first quarter have beat the consensus. Annually, the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose steadily and met estimates while core HCPI, that excludes food and energy prices, softened on a slower pace. I'm quite surprised by the reaction in the euro to the data in the last few minutes. It surely isn't the GDP numbers as they were already well telegraphed by the national readings earlier. DXY climbs to 105.839, suggesting potential gains if it holds above the 105.521 pivot in upcoming trading sessions. EUR/USD looks tired ahead of key inflation and GDP data from the continent later Tuesday, struggling to hold the gains which took it to two-week highs on Friday. The EUR/USD pair meets with some supply during the Asian session on Tuesday and erodes a part of the previous day's gains amid the emergence of fresh US Dollar (USD) buying. Spot prices, however, remain in a familiar range held over the past week or so and currently trade around the 1.0700 round-figure mark.",1.06665,1.06887,1.06501,1.06665,1

However, market participants were hoping for further signs of impending rate cuts from the US central bank. The US Dollar put in a steep fall around a Fed that was more dovish than many expected, even in light of continued strength in inflation. The focus now shifts to NFP on Friday as the next major US data point. EUR/USD bumped slightly higher after the Federal Reserve (Fed) released its latest rate outlook, with the US central bank citing an improvement in inflationary conditions, though targets remain unhit and progress has slowed. The US Dollar (USD) eased broadly and risk appetite is taking a cautious step forward. The US dollar consolidated its gains from the day before, with investors wary of a potentially more hawkish Fed meeting later today. Today's US data releases were far from great, but more signs of stickly inflation emerged from the manufacturing sector. Forex traders are cautious ahead of the key event of the week. The EUR/USD pair is trading mildly higher at 1.0682, with a daily variation of 0.12% on Wednesday's session. The US reported soft ISM PMIs and Job Openings figures which seem to be weighing on the Greenback. The FOMC will obviously take front and center stage on Wednesday as traders are trying to sort out what the Fed will do. The EUR/USD pair finds a provisional support near 1.0650 in Wednesday's European session. The near-term outlook for the major currency pair remains bearish as investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's (Fed) monetary policy announcement at 18:00 GMT. The Euro is struggling against the a resurgent US dollar as rate cut expectations between the two continue to widen. Today's FOMC may underpin thoughts that the Fed is comfortable with rates staying higher for longer. Anticipation mounts as the Fed holds interest rates steady at 5.50%, setting the stage for potential shifts in EUR/USD and GBP/USD dynamics. On the hourly chart of EUR/USD at FXOpen, the pair failed to clear the 1.0750 resistance. The Euro started a fresh decline below the 1.0700 support against the US Dollar, as mentioned in the previous analysis. The significance of today's FOMC meeting has continued to grow, as incoming US economic data has continued to surprise to the upside. And with that, expectations of any rate cuts this year have been crushed – which is impressive when you consider markets were pricing in five or more cuts just three months ago. EUR/USD continues its decline for the second consecutive day, hovering around 1.0650 during Asian trading hours on Wednesday.

The EUR/USD exchange rate rose for the second day straight even as it became clear that the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve will diverge this year. The pair rose to a high of 1.0725 ahead of Friday's nonfarm payrolls data. This article provides an in-depth examination of the U.S. dollar's fundamental and technical outlook, considering various scenarios that could unfold after the April U.S. jobs report is released. USD/JPY is under pressure after interventions from the BoJ. The euro continues to see a lot of stagnation more than anything else, as the markets remain a bit sideways. Confusion might be a good word for what is going on at the moment. EUR/USD is stuck in a tight range above the round-level support of 1.0700 in Thursday's European session. The upside in the major currency pair remains restricted around 1.0736 this week as the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to start lowering its key borrowing rates from the June meeting, while the Federal Reserve's (Fed) slightly less-hawkish guidance on interest rates has supported the downside. As DXY edges up supported at $105.620, EUR/USD and GBP/USD face critical resistance levels, signaling potential reversals. EUR/USD continues to gain ground on Thursday as the prevailing positive sentiment in the market provides support for risk-sensitive currencies like the Euro. This improved risk appetite could be attributed to dovish remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday.

This article examines the outlook for the U.S. dollar, with a specific focus on two prominent currency pairs: EUR/USD and GBP/USD. Additionally, the piece analyzes fundamental factors that could influence the market trajectory in the near term. Forex markets are calm, but USD/JPY continues to rebound after the recent sell-off. Euro surged 2% off the yearly lows registered last month with EUR/USD attempting to mark a fourth-consecutive rally this week. The advance is approaching the first major test of resistance into the May opening-range and the focus is on possible topside exhaustion / price inflection into this key threshold. The euro rose slightly in the early hours on Monday, but at this point in time I think you have a situation where we are trying to get a read on where we are going over the longer term. EUR/USD strives for a direction, trading sideways around 1.0770 in Monday's European session. The major currency pair consolidates as the Eurozone economic calendar lacks tier-1 data this week. With the Dollar Index nudging a critical pivot at $105.166, experts hint at potential bullish signals—could this be your cue to buy? Looking at the 4-hour chart, the pair broke a major bearish trend line with resistance at 1.0720. There was a decent increase above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the 1.0885 swing high to the 1.0601 low.

Risk appetite was crimped on Tuesday after Fedspeak from key US Federal Reserve (Fed) officials threw caution on hopes for approaching rate cuts from the Fed, but rate markets are still betting on at least two cuts in 2024, with the first cut expected in September. The US Dollar has moved back to the 105.00 level and, so far, that's helped to hold support. There was penetration on Friday after the NFP report, but bulls brought it back above the big figure by the close of trading for the week, and so far, this week price has held a higher-low with bulls making a more notable appearance on Tuesday. U.S. Dollar Index climbed above the 105.00 level as the rebound continued. EUR/USD stages a five-day advance after negating a bear-flag formation, but the exchange rate may track the negative slope in the 50-Day SMA (1.0793) as it struggles to close above the moving average. EUR/USD continues to press higher, aided in part by a weak US dollar. The pair are now closing in on a zone of resistance that may prove difficult to break. EURUSD has been in a recovery mode since April 16 when it hit support near the 1.0610 area. Since then, the pair has been respecting an upside support line, which let it on Friday back within the sideways range that has been containing most of the price action since mid-November. The euro stuttered a bit on Tuesday, as we continue to see a lot of hesitation in this pair. EUR/USD is slightly down by 0.10% at 1.0760 in Tuesday's European session. The shared currency pair is broadly sideways around 1.0770 amid indecisiveness among investors due to the absence of high-tier data in the United States (US) and the Eurozone. German factory orders unexpectedly dropped 0.4% in March after falling 0.8% in the previous month, defying expectations of a 0.4% gain. The data points to persistent weakness in the sector, which is already lagging behind improvements in the wider economy. With the Dollar Index hitting $105, market watchers anticipate further gains amid shifting economic indicators and upcoming Federal Reserve statements. EUR/USD snaps its four-day winning streak, trading around 1.0760 during the Asian hours on Tuesday. However, the Euro found support from higher-than-expected Eurozone Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data released on Monday.",1.07505,1.07585,1.07357,1.07505,0

European market flows are set to be thin on Thursday with German and French markets shuttered for the Ascension Day holiday, and US data is set to be strictly mid-tier until Friday's University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. While EUR/USD has been range-bound for more than a year now, there have been several shorter-term trends to work with. And from the daily chart, we can see how those trends have shown in a relatively clean manner as driven by larger macro themes. USD/JPY moved above the psychologically important 155.00 level as traders ignored intervention risks. The EUR/USD pair fell a bit during the session on Wednesday, as we continue to see traders bet on the idea that the European Central Bank will be forced to cut rates sooner than the Federal Reserve. EUR/USD is slightly down to 1.0740 in Wednesday's European session. The major currency pair drops as the US Dollar rises as comments from central bank officials become the main market movers in the absence of top-tier economic data in the Eurozone and the United States. After a run up against the 1.0800 level on Friday, EUR/USD is not finding much follow through to take another run at the key level.

The Bank of England edged closer to a rate cut, although stopped short of announcing any such moved for June as I suspected. Seven of the nine MPC members voted to hold (down from eight) and two to cut (up from one), with a “range of views” among MPC members voting to hold suggesting that a June cut is not yet a slam dunk. The euro is on course to register the fourth successive week of wins against the US dollar, as a series of weak US data weigh down the dollar. Signs of job market weakness may force the Fed to be less hawkish, which is bearish for the American currency. There are no two ways about it: This week's economic calendar is completely bereft of major macroeconomic data out of Europe, leaving traders to digest developments from other major economies, some of the second-tier earnings reports, and any relevant technical considerations to guide their trading decisions this week. The euro drifted a little bit lower during the early hours on Thursday, but at this point in time it looks like we are simply rudderless and looking for some type of momentum. EUR/USD extends its losing spell for the third trading session on Thursday. The major currency pair is on the back foot due to firm speculation that the European Central Bank (ECB) will start lowering its interest rates in June.

EUR/USD is making another effort to break above the 200-day moving average and this is a situation that could be impacted dramatically on Wednesday after the release of US CPI. The American currency is moving lower as traders wait for catalysts. MUFG considers that the dollar will struggle to make net gains, especially given strong positioning in favour of the currency while further evidence of a weaker US economy would trigger significant losses. EUR/USD has been resilient this month and is currently trading around 1.0775. The euro continues to be choppy at this point in time, as we have no real ability to see clarity. EUR/USD rises to 1.0780 in Monday's European session due to improved market sentiment. The major currency pair holds gains as traders have priced in that interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank (ECB) will be more and start earlier than the Federal Reserve (Fed). Oil settled over $1.00 lower on Friday as Federal Reserve officials continued to support the view that interest rates need to remain high for longer to bring inflation back to the 2% target. A higher interest rate environment could result in slower growth, hurting the demand outlook. During the previous week's meeting, the Federal Reserve displayed a less aggressive stance than anticipated, as Chair Powell explicitly stated that there would be no increases in interest rates and suggested that they are still inclined towards reducing rates.

The pair is heading into a densely-packed economic data docket on Wednesday, with European Gross Domestic Product (GDO) and US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation figures due throughout the day. Following the latest U.S economic data, including a Fed rate hold and negative results from ISM Manufacturing PMI, ISM Services PMI, Non-Farm Payrolls, consumer sentiment, and advance GDP, the upcoming April CPI results are expected to cool down, poising bullish volatility on EURUSD charts, unless reported otherwise. Fed Chair Powell noted that PPI data was mixed and pointed to revisions of the March report. Germany's inflation rate remained unchanged in April at 2.2% y/y, matching the market consensus. Services inflation slowed but this was offset by higher food prices. The euro continues to see a lot of noise at this point in time, as the market is likely to see this 1.08 level as pivotal. This is a market that has a lot of lackluster momentum to say the least at this point in time. The EUR/USD recovered from earlier weakness to turn slightly positive on the back of further improvement in German data. Now up for the fifth week, the key question remains as to whether the EUR/USD will be able to rise more meaningfully or find resistance again around the key 1.08 handle. EUR/USD falls slightly below the round-level resistance of 1.0800 in Tuesday's European session.

The spike in the price, however, proved short-lived, with the pair returning to its pre-CPI level near 1.0830 in the next hours. The euro has rallied a bit as of late, but it currently facing a fairly significant hurdle above, and therefore we could see an inflection point take front and center. The core CPI, which excludes Energy and food products, came in at 3.8% in March, slightly higher than 3.75% in February 2004. The uptick was mainly driven again by a rise in the cost of services. The Euro keeps firm tone and hits new five-week high in early European trading on Wednesday.

The EUR/USD pair extends the rally near 1.0825 on Wednesday during the early European trading hours. The uptick of the major pair is bolstered by the upbeat ZEW Economic Sentiment Survey and the softer US Dollar (USD).

In this article, we conduct a thorough analysis of EUR/USD and GBP/USD from a technical standpoint, meticulously studying how price action dynamics and prevailing market sentiment currently intertwine. Key tech levels are also discussed. Comparing the November 2023 ECB Financial Review with that of 2024, an improvement in economic data is present. With a noticeable trend out of recession risks and with inflation figures aligning towards the 2% target, the revision reflected higher possibilities for a soft landing. The euro found the 1.09 level as a bit of a barrier at the beginning of the Thursday session, and therefore it is likely that we will continue to follow the same pattern time and time again.

Talking points from Federal Reserve (Fed) officials dominated headlines, but provided little new information for investors to digest, keeping risk appetite suppressed and stapling bids close to opening prices. The US Dollar was smashed last Wednesday after the release of US CPI. Core CPI printed at a three-year-low and this quickly excited the rate cut crowd, and that really extended a story that's been prevalent for all of May so far. Fed Governor Christopher Waller wants to see several months of good inflation data before cutting rates. The euro has continued to grind against the US dollar, as we are still looking at the area between 1.09 and 1.10 as a result of the two central banks both looking likely to cut rates sooner rather than later? Nordea expects that Euro to Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate will come under pressure as the ECB cuts rates before the Federal Reserve. It forecasts a decline to 1.04 in three months before a very tentative recovery and an advance to 1.10 at the end of 2025. The US dollar has been trading inside tight ranges in the last few days due to the lack of any fresh major catalysts and a holiday across most of mainland Europe on Monday. There are no major US data scheduled for today either, although there will be plenty of Fed peak that could potentially impact the US dollar. EUR/USD is stuck in a tight range near 1.0850 in Tuesday's European session. The major currency pair is expected to continue its sideways performance as the US Dollar (USD) stabilizes ahead of the publication later this week of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes and the preliminary S&P Global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data for May. The dollar index rises to 104.60 as markets anticipate key speeches from Fed officials, impacting EUR/USD and GBP/USD pairs.

EUR/USD knocked lower on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's (Fed) latest Meeting Minutes revealed the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are grimly determined to wait for more proof inflation will ease to 2%, sending risk appetite lower as rate-cut-hungry investors keep hoping for dovish signs from the US central bank. EUR/USD strength has been ongoing for more than a month now. The pair found support near the lower-end of a range that's been in-play since the 2023 open and since then, bulls have been going to work. U.S. Dollar Index is trying to settle above the 104.75 level. Euro continues to see a lot of noisy behavior, but at this point in time it is obvious that the market will continue to more or less focus on the central banks at this juncture. EUR/USD is stuck in a tight range around 1.0850 in Wednesday's European session. The major currency pair is expected to remain sideways ahead of the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes later in the day and the Eurozone/United States preliminary Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data for May, which will be published on Thursday. The DXY holds steady at 104.64, but the upcoming FOMC minutes could spark significant market movements. Price action has been on the scrappy side for forex majors this week so far, excluding the New Zealand dollar due to a surprisingly hawkish RBNZ meeting. Any hopes of a slight dovish twinge in today's RBNZ meeting were quickly dashed, as the minutes revealed that the RBNZ actually discussed hiking rates at this meeting. EUR/USD remains stable ahead of the release of the Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on May 1, scheduled for Wednesday.

This sent investors into the safe-haven US Dollar and deflated the Euro despite better-than-expected HCOB PMI figures earlier in the day. The recent rally in EUR/USD appears to have stalled ahead of the March high (1.0981) as it extends the decline from the start of the week, but the exchange rate may hold within the monthly range if it snaps the recent series of lower highs and lows. Strong PMI data pushed Treasury yields higher, which was bullish for the American currency. The Euro regained traction and bounced 0.3%, after pullback from 1.0895 (May 16 high) was repeatedly rejected at 100DMA (1.0814), generating initial signal of a double-bottom and potential end of corrective phase. The euro continues to see a lot of back and forth trading, as the markets are trying to figure out where to go next. The markets will continue to pay close attention to the idea of which central bank cuts first, and by how much. The EUR/USD rebounded, while the US dollar weakened against most major currencies in the first half of Thursday's session. The dollar weakness follows a stronger performance for much of this week, with gains driven by hawkish Fedspeak and the FOMC minutes released yesterday. Last night, the FOMC meeting minutes were released. According to USNews, there were no major surprises. EUR/USD witnesses a stellar buying interest after posting a fresh weekly low near the crucial support of 1.0800 in Thursday's European session. The major currency pair capitalizes on a decline in the US Dollar and strong Eurozone preliminary PMI numbers for May. The euro area PMI data was a bit mixed but at the balance, it was salvaged by the better German PMI figures. That continues to give the ECB a bit of breathing room after their impending June rate cut at least. With DXY at $104.85, traders are closely monitoring PMI data for potential impacts on EUR/USD and GBP/USD. Above-consensus April inflation figures in the UK triggered an obvious underperformance of gilts, resulting in yield gains between 7.2 (30-yr) and 14.2 bps (2-yr). A June rate cut by the BoE is just short of fully priced out. EUR/USD treads water to halt its three-day losing streak, hovering around 1.0820 during the Asian session on Thursday. The Euro's appreciation against the US Dollar (USD) can be attributed to a corrective move for the latter. Last week I mused as to whether the dollar's next directional move could be down to a trendline.

The economic calendar, however, will heat up heading into the weekend with the release of Eurozone inflation and US core PCE data, two critical reports for policymakers that could unleash greater volatility. Weaker-than-expected UK data, together with a US Dollar rebound, hampered Sterling with the Pound unable to break key resistance levels. The dollar posted a notable advance after Thursday's business confidence data with the Pound to Dollar (GBP/USD) exchange rate sliding below the 1.2700 level and it traded close to this level on. According to Danske Bank, although tight ranges will continue initially some signs of vulnerability in the US economy and a Euro-Zone recovery could lead to slight topside risks for the Euro to Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate. Markets are now pricing in less than a 20% chance of US interest rates being cut in July. Technical studies on EUR/USD suggest buyers could take control, bound for daily resistance.

Tuesday will kick off the Fiber's trading week in earnest after German sentiment surveys hobbled the Euro (EUR) on Monday. The American currency is moving lower at the start of the week. The euro continues to see a lot of sideways action in general. The market continues to see a lot of questions around the 1.08 level and the 1.09 level. Investors may turn their focus to the US core PCE price index for April on Friday, which is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. Following a period of stability at 2.8% y/y in March, there are indications that the core PCE rate may see a slight decrease, which is supported by the relaxation of the core CPI rate. EUR/USD is stuck in a tight range around 1.0850 in Monday's European session, in a calm start to the week ahead of the release of inflation data on both sides of the Atlantic on Friday. The major currency pair exhibits strength as European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers avoid to commit about extending the rate-cut cycle beyond the June meeting. EURUSD had been in a steady advance following its 2024 bottom of 1.0600 on April 16. However, the pair reversed lower after its rejection at a fresh two-month high of 1.0894 in mid-May, with the price finding strong support just above its long-term downward sloping trendline.

Key US data hides just around the corner with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index inflation due on Thursday and Friday, respectively. The 10-year Treasury is seeing yields jump back-above 4.5%, and that was the item that I led with in this webinar, sharing a bit about its correlation with equities of late. Yields snapped back aggressively after the FOMC rate decision on May 1st and caught another shot-in-the-arm on the 15th of the month after the release of CPI. The strong CB Consumer Confidence report did not provide sufficient support to the American currency. The euro rallied during the session on Tuesday, as we are looking to determine whether or not the EUR/USD pair can finally break above the 1.09 level, an area that has been important more than once. The EUR/USD edged higher at the start of the week, adding to the gains it made on Monday and Friday. Last week, the EUR/USD was on the backfoot until Friday, when it reversed from around the key 1.08 support level. The Euro keeps firm tone on fading hopes for ECB rate cut, with markets focusing on tomorrow's release of German inflation data (annualized CPI expected to rise in May). EUR/USD posts a fresh weekly high at 1.0880 in Tuesday's European session. The major currency pair strengthens amid soft US Dollar (USD) and deepening uncertainty over the pace at which the European Central Bank (ECB) will reduce key borrowing rates after the June meeting. With DXY dropping below $104.50, expect more sell-offs. EUR/USD at $1.08767, GBP/USD at $1.27756 reflect market shifts. The US dollar index is currently down -1.7% in May, which has effectively seen it wipe off April's gains and snap a 4-month rally. The last time the dollar rose for four months was just ahead of the 2022 high, and if history were to repeat it points to another couple of months of the dollar's decline and for bearish momentum to accelerate.

EUR/USD pulled back sharply on Wednesday, falling back to the 1.0800 handle after broad risk appetite evaporated. The pair is trading firmly into technical resistance as investors gear up for a batch of mid-tier European economic indicators on Thursday, followed by an update to US quarterly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. Forex traders bet that Fed will stay hawkish in the near term. It was mid-April and the pair was bristling lower after the release of US CPI. At the time, there was a fairly clear deviation between European and US economies, as inflation had already softened quite a bit in Europe while it had become a bit stickier in the US, bringing to question the Fed's ability to cut rates in the next few months. German inflation grew on an annualised basis, data released today showed, but the market still believes that the ECB will start cutting interest rates next week As we saw in the last two weeks, the Euro managed to hold trades above the first support at 1.0820. As we can see from the chart, if price action trades above 1.0820, then there is a chance for a further advance toward 1.0980, which could hit the market. The Euro continues to see a lot of sideways action, as we are just bouncing back and forth between the 1.08 level on the bottom, and the 1.09 level on the top. EUR/USD falls to 1.0830 in Wednesday's European session after failing to recapture a two-month high near 1.0900 on Tuesday. The major currency pair retraces as the market sentiment turns cautious ahead of the release of the Eurozone preliminary Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for May and the United States (US) core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE) data for April, which will be published on Friday. On the hourly chart of EUR/USD at FXOpen, the pair gained pace for a move above the 1.0850 zone, as mentioned in the previous analysis. The Euro tested the 1.0890 resistance and recently corrected gains against the US Dollar. The US dollar is rising against its major peers after stronger than expected consumer confidence data and following hawkish commentary from more Federal Reserve officials. With the Dollar Index (DXY) rising to 104.635, markets await the Beige Book for further economic insights. Can EUR/USD and GBP/USD hold their ground?

US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth eased in-line with market expectations, and rate-cut-hopeful investors are taking a cautious step forward ahead of Friday's key data prints. U.S. dollar found itself under pressure as traders reacted to U.S. economic reports. Euro rallied nearly 2.8% off the yearly lows registered in April with EUR/USD exhausting just ahead of major resistance for the past few weeks. The focus now shifts to the June open with the multi-week advance vulnerable here at multi-month highs ahead of the ECB rate decision. The beginning of a new month marks a good opportunity to review the seasonal patterns that have influenced the forex market over the 50+ years since the Bretton Woods system was dismantled in 1971, ushering in the modern foreign exchange market. The Euro fell below the 1.0815 support yesterday, which could cause a further correction to test the support of 1.0725-45, activating another advance. If the market holds below 1.0830, the drop towards 1.0725-45 could continue, while above 1.0830, price action could move back again to re-test the resistance zone 1.0885-95. The US dollar, already giving back some of its gains from Wednesday, fell a little further on the back of today's US data releases that, among other things, showed a slight downward revision in GDP and an uptick in jobless claims. The EUR/USD, which had been on the backfoot ever since Tuesday when it failed to break key resistance around 1.0885 area before slumping on Wednesday on the back of weaker-than-expect German CPI data and a decent dollar rally, edged higher to around 1.0830 following the latest US data releases. The euro bounced a bit in the early hours of Thursday, as the market continues to see a lot of interest at the 1.08 and the 1.09 levels. This means that the market doesn't necessarily have any real conviction at the moment, much like the rest of the majors pairs The Euro is consolidating in early Thursday, following a sharp fall on Wednesday (the pair was down 0.5% in the biggest daily loss since Apr 30), driven by fresh risk aversion. As the EUR/USD chart today shows, yesterday the rate dropped by 0.46% – the most significant strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in one day this month. Moreover, the rate fell below the psychological mark of 1.08 euros per dollar (in the first half of May, it served as resistance). EUR/USD came under heavy bearish pressure in the American session on Wednesday and closed the day deep in negative territory as safe-haven flows dominated the action in financial markets. After dipping to its lowest level in two weeks below 1.0800 in the Asian session on Thursday, the pair recovered back above 1.0800. With DXY trading at $105.130, market signals hint at a bearish correction ahead for EUR/USD and GBP/USD. Key support levels to watch closely. EUR/USD extends its downside below the crucial support of 1.0800 in Thursday's European session.

We're now in an important spot of the economic calendar as the next two weeks bring rate decisions out of both Europe and the United States.

Because of this, the market continues to see a lot chopping at this The Euro started to lose traction in European trading on Monday, adding to initial warning from Friday's daily candle with long upper shadow, which was formed after strong upside rejection. The eurozone manufacturing sector is still contracting but there is light at the end of the tunnel. The manufacturing PMI rose to 47.3 in May, up from 45.7 in April and just shy of the market estimate of 47.4. The Fed is not expected to cut interest rates before September according to futures markets, and although the wolves of Wall Street are not fond of this scenario, the US dollar can enjoy more winning moments in FX markets. EUR/USD struggles to sustain above 1.0850 in Monday's European session. The major currency pair faces pressure as the revised HCOB Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) showed that factory data dropped slightly to 47.3 from the consensus and the preliminary reading of 47.4. EUR/USD is falling modestly after the pair remained unchanged across the previous week.  The pair continues to trade around the 1.0850 level after softer-than-expected monthly core PCE data on Friday and hotter-than-expected eurozone inflation figures. As DXY hovers around $104.60, EUR/USD at $1.08530 and GBP/USD at $1.27365 await crucial manufacturing reports. Looking at the momentum indicators, the RSI is lacking direction slightly above the neutral threshold of 50, suggesting that the market could keep consolidating in the near term. The MACD also supports this view in the positive territory but is currently embraced by its red signal line. EUR/USD extends its gains for the third straight day, trading around 1.0850 during the Asian session on Monday. A technical analysis of a daily chart suggests a bullish bias for the pair, as it moves upward within the ascending triangle.

US dollar setups come into focus as data weakens. EUR/USD awaits ECB cut, AUD/USD eyes lower levels on waning risk appetite, and USD/CHF flashes overheating signals after a sharp drop Falling Treasury yields did not put any pressure on the American currency.

This isn't a secret and that expectation has been there for a while, but that hasn't stopped the Euro from gaining ground against the US Dollar since mid-April. Forex traders ignored falling Treasury yields and focused on the strength of the U.S. services sector. The Euro broke the resistance of 1.0895, which could signify an extension. On the chart, the market is facing an uptrend support of around 1.0785-95. Global inflationary pressures are assumed to ease down with the significant slide of oil prices, favoring central bank rate cut decisions. The market has potentially priced in tomorrow's 25 bp ECB rate cut, and a higher weight can be allocated towards the monetary policy statement given no surprising expectations. The euro hasn't done more than a one hundred point wing over the last several weeks, and it looks like we are going to be stuck for a while. However, the ECB announcement and the Non-Farm Payroll numbers on Friday certainly could cause a lot of volatility. EUR/USD is stuck in a tight range around 1.0880 in Wednesday's European session. The major currency pair turns rangebound amid caution ahead of the European Central Bank's (ECB) interest rate decision, which will be announced on Thursday.

We've now had a good few hours gone past the European Central Bank's decision to cut interest rates and overall, the response in the EUR/USD has been quite muted. This suggests that the move was expected by the market, with investors already looking ahead to Friday's US jobs report as well as CPI and FOMC rate decision in the week ahead. The ECB Interest Rate Decision provided some support to the European currency. Euro is virtually unchanged since the start of the week with EUR/USD trading just below near-term resistance ahead of tomorrow US employment report. The battle lines are drawn as the April rally approaches multi-month highs with the key inflation data and the Fed on tap next week. The euro has essentially gone sideways during the session, as the market will be noisy overall, especially since the ECB cut, but was noncommittal in general. Because of this, the market is likely to see very little in the way of decisiveness. As seen in our previous chart, the Euro broke above the resistance of 1.0895, which could signify a further advance. The market is facing an uptrend, with the support zone around 1.0785-95. The Euro to Dollar exchange rate (EUR/USD) strengthened to 2-month highs above 1.09 this week before settling around 1.0880. BNP Paribas expects the Euro gains will not be sustained and forecasts a retreat to 1.05 at the end of 2024. Although there is a risk of near-term losses, MUFG considers that a stronger Euro-Zone economy, allied with an ECB decision not to cut rates aggressively, will strengthen the Euro over the medium term. EUR/USD is forecast at 1.12 by March 2025. Thursday's ECB rate cut and the subsequent rise in the Euro suggest a bearish outlook for the U.S. Dollar Index in the short term. The Euro edged higher on Thursday morning and partially reversed a two-day pullback from new multi-week high (1.0915), but today's action was so far choppy and lacking direction, as traders await the verdict from the ECB later today. European Central Bank is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.75%, down from the record 4%. This would mark the first rate cut in almost five years, but it comes against a somewhat unique backdrop for a rate cut. EUR/USD rises in Thursday's European session but remains broadly sideways below the round-level resistance of 1.0900. The major currency pair is expected to remain quiet ahead of the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy decision, which will be announced at 12:15 GMT. The Dollar Index remains steady near 104.20, with market attention now shifting to the upcoming US Unemployment Claims data. The ECB is expected to cut all three interest rates today by 25 basis points (bp). This would mark the first cut in the deposit facility since September 2019, while the lending facility and refinancing rate were last cut eight years ago. The European Central Bank is scheduled to announce its main refinancing rate on its June 6th, 2024 meeting, traders around the world are looking forward to the central bank's decision and how it may impact the EURO exchange rate against other currencies.

U.S. Dollar Index is trying to settle below the 105.50 level. In this webinar we take an in-depth look at the technical trade levels for the US Dollar (DXY), 10yr Treasury Yields, Euro (EUR/USD), British Pound (GBP/USD), Japanese Yen (USD/JPY), Australian Dollar (AUD/USD), Canadian Dollar (USD/CAD), Swiss Franc (USD/CHF), Gold (XAU/USD), Crude Oil (WTI), S&P 500 (SPX500), Nasdaq (NDX), Dow Jones (DJI), Bitcoin (BTC/USD) and the Mexican Peso (USD/MXN). These are the levels that matter on the technical charts heading into the weekly open. Given the euro's continued weakness and the Fed's cautious stance on rate cuts, the U.S. dollar is likely to remain firm in the short term. The euro is currently hanging about the 1.07 level, as we are trying to determine where we are going next. This market will continue to see a lot of back and forth, as we are in a larger consolidation region. EURUSD has undergone some volatile sessions in the past few days, eventually dipping beneath both its 50- and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs), to a fresh one-month low. Also, the pair broke below its descending trendline in place since December further deteriorating the technical outlook The EURUSD currency pair has received support amid jitters over EU politics as the latest data show that US inflation rate declined in May. The French/Macron-driven risk-off continued to rage across European markets last Friday. European risk premia again leaped aggressively higher. All eyes on US data as a potential catalyst for the dollar index, currently at 105.50, to either extend its gains or reverse course. EUR/USD trades in a tight range near the crucial support of 1.0700 in Monday's early European session. The major currency pair has been under pressure as potential risks of the financial crisis in France amid firm speculation that Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) will form a new government, which will have an adverse impact on the nation's fiscal situation, that has dampened Euro's appeal.

Broad-market sentiment continues to grind its way upwards as investors shrug off overly cautious talking points from a slew of Federal Reserve (Fed) officials. The US Dollar had a big outing in the back-half of last week, with a major push point from the FOMC rate decision. While the Fed had forecast 2-3 cuts back in March, they whittled that down to 1-2 cuts at last Wednesday's meeting and given that this had taken place after the ECB had already cut rates, it allowed for USD-strength to re-appear. U.S. dollar is swinging between gains and losses despite the pullback in Treasury yields. The euro continues to see a lot of drifting at this point, as the market has been bouncing around a few major levels. This is a market that believe will continue to be noisy, and I think we will struggle to find any real direction. The EURUSD is in a precarious position, with the European Parliamentary elections extending its impact in the markets ahead of US retail data Following last week's 1% drop, the EUR/USD has been a little more stable so far this week.

The new trading week is kicking things off with risk appetite firmly pinned higher, sending the US Dollar lower and bolstering the Euro as investors head into a relatively quiet Tuesday. The EURUSD pair endured a decline in investor confidence following the European elections, but there are signs of improving sentiment. EUR/USD snaps the series of lower highs and lows from last week as it bounces back ahead of the monthly low (1.0668), but the exchange rate may stage further attempts to test the May low (1.0650) as the Federal Reserve retains a restrictive policy. DXY sentiment is mixed, balancing the dollar's safe-haven appeal with potential policy shifts. EUR/USD and USD/JPY also reflect this uncertainty. This week we will have a few high-impact data releases from the economic calendar. Still, the focus will be on several speeches by Fed officials, with five out of eight appearances scheduled featuring hawkish members. Our previous model is still valid with the EURUSD pair as we see on our previous chart. The market moved close to the triangle support trend around 1.0650, if prices hold above this support, a rebound correction could happen with resistance around 1.0850 and 1.0915. The EUR/USD rose along with equity indices in Europe in the first half of Monday's session. It remains to be seen if the gains can be maintained, however, amid ongoing political uncertainty in France and across Europe. The euro bounced a bit in the early hours on Monday, as we continue to see a lot of noisy behavior, as we are watching to see whether or not the Federal Reserve will be cutting rates later this year. The single currency regained traction despite weaker than expected German Ifo data, as sentiment improves on growing expectations on ECB rate cut, following recent weak economic data. This morning's IFO data confirm what the PMIs told us – expectations are down, FX strategist at Societe Generale Kit Juckes notes. The EUR/USD pair recovers strongly from a weekly low of 1.0670 in Monday's European session. The major currency pair bounces back as the appeal for risk-sensitive assets improves amid growing speculation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will start reducing interest rates in the September meeting and will deliver two rate cuts this year. The Euro (EUR) is likely to trade in a range, probably between 1.0665 and 1.0715. Bias for EUR remains on the downside; it must break clearly below 1.0665 before further decline can be expected, UOB Group analysts note. EUR/USD Price Analysis: Trims losses near 1.0700, the bearish outlook remains intact EUR/USD and NZD/USD have returned to territory where they've attracted buying in the recent past. Given this week is likely to confirm ebbing inflationary pressures in the United States, adding to the case for Fed rate cuts, and with French election uncertainty now arguably priced in, there's fuel around to spark some form of squeeze in the days ahead. The Euro failed to recover above the 1.0765 resistance against the US Dollar. EUR/USD started another decline and traded below the 1.0720 support. The EUR/USD pair remains depressed for the third straight day on Monday and trades around the 1.0690-1.0685 region during the Asian session, just above its lowest level since early May. ",1.07327,1.07458,1.06922,1.07327,0

The euro was under pressure in the first half of Wednesday's session, ahead of the French snap election and due to growing signs of weakness in Germany's economy. This political uncertainty has bolstered the US dollar, especially against currencies where the central bank is more dovish or where interest rates are significantly lower than the US – for example the Japanese yen. The main focus for the Euro (EUR) is on French elections in the short term.

Bullish momentum was cut short after US activity figures flashed warning signs of a steepening economic downturn. Developments coming out of the Euro-Area may sway EUR/USD as the ECB promotes a data-dependent approach in managing monetary policy. The disappointing ISM Manufacturing PMI report did not put pressure on the American currency. As seen on our previous chart, we still hold our previous outlook for the EURUSD. The market closed from the triangle support trend and managed to print a 1.0665 low last week. Outcome of the first round of French legislative election saw no major surprises, OCBC strategists Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong note. In the near term, the U.S. Dollar Index may face further downward pressure as traders anticipate dovish signals from the Federal Reserve. The euro continues to see a lot of back and forth noise, as we are seeing a bit of a reaction to the French elections. However, we will need to also watch the bond market in the USA, as if the interest rates rise, this will work for the USD, EURUSD rose further on Monday as the market reacted to news that France's far-right National Rally wouldn't secure a first-round majority win. The Euro (EUR) is trading stronger this morning after the outcome of the first-round French parliamentary elections came in quite close to polls, with a victory for the National Rally. We think this week's US data can push EUR/USD higher, but French politics can still put a cap on the pair this summer, ING FX strategist Francesco Pesole notes. EURUSD opened with gap-higher and rose to three-week high in early European trading on Monday, lifted by results of the first round French parliamentary election. It's tough to see this bounce as being any more than a slight relief for now. There were no major surprises to the outcome of the first round of votes in the French elections. EURUSD opened with a positive gap on Monday after Le Pen's far right party dominated the first round of the election on Sunday with a smaller margin than analysts expected, increasing speculation that an absolute majority on July 7 might be a struggle for the Euro-sceptic party. According to Reuters, exit polls show that Marine Le Pen's far-right party, the National Rally (RN), won the first round of parliamentary elections in France on Sunday. The Euro (EUR) could edge higher, but any advance is unlikely to break above 1.0760. EUR is likely to trade in a range for now, probably between 1.0680 and 1.0785, UOB Group analysts suggest. EUR/USD gains 0.50% and jumps to more than a two-week high near 1.0770 in Monday's European session. The major currency pair strengthens as exit polls of the first round of France's parliamentary elections on Sunday showed that Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) is in a comfortable position but with a smaller margin than projected and a significant correction in the US Dollar (USD). Core bonds sold off into the final trading hours last Friday. We didn't spot an obvious reason underpinning the move. DXY's recent drop below 105.50 signals potential for further declines, influencing EUR/USD and GBP/USD trading dynamics as economic data unfolds. The EUR/USD pair builds on last week's rebound from the 1.0665 region, or a nearly two-month low and gains strong positive traction for the third successive day on Monday. The momentum lifts spot prices to the 1.0760 area, or a two-week high during the Asian session and is sponsored by a combination of factors. EUR/USD opened for trade in very early Asia time (just New Zealand active) around 15-20 points higher than where it finished up late on Friday. This is not an epic gap up, but hey, its what we got. The Euro started a decent recovery wave from the 1.0665 zone against the US Dollar. EUR/USD cleared the 1.0710 resistance to move into a short-term positive zone. EUR/USD extends its gains for the third successive day, trading around 1.0750 during the Asian hours on Monday.

Key labor data from the US looms ahead on Friday, and EU economic figures remain scattered throughout the back half of the trading week. Powell's words about disinflation trends did not put pressure on the American currency. We look towards our previous outlook for the EURUSD for the past few weeks as see on our previous chart. The Euro yesterday advanced toward the first resistance of 1.0760. By RoboForex Analytical Department The EUR/USD pair experienced a noticeable uptick yesterday, but failed to sustain its peak, settling at 1.0732 today. Early gains were buoyed by the initial outcomes from France's parliamentary elections, which did not reflect the worst-case scenario, sparking a temporary surge in risk appetite and bolstering the euro. The EUR/USD was bouncing off its earlier lows but wasn't going anywhere fast amid elections uncertainty in France, ahead of the release of US job openings data, which will come in just a few days ahead of the non-farm payrolls report on Friday. This morning saw the release of a slightly stronger-than-expected Eurozone core CPI inflation data, but this hardly had any impact as investors remain focused on politics. The Euro has pulled back a bit during the early hours on Tuesday, but it looks like we are fairly well supported, especially around the 1.07 level. The EUR/USD gapped up by 26 pips at the start of yesterday, 1 July Asian session from last Friday, 28 June US session close of 1.0713 on a positive backdrop that preliminary results of the first round of the French legislation election that saw Le Pen's far-right National Rally party took the lead but without a majority foothold ahead of the far-left coalition party, New Popular Front while French President Macron's centrist alliance dwindled to third place. The National Rally party fell short of obtaining the absolute majority of 289 seats to control the French Parliament. The EUR/USD pair experienced a noticeable uptick yesterday, but failed to sustain its peak, settling at 1.0732 today. Early gains were buoyed by the initial outcomes from France's parliamentary elections, which did not reflect the worst-case scenario, sparking a temporary surge in risk appetite and bolstering the euro. The euro has given back some of yesterday's gains as investors continue to digest the first round of French elections and look ahead to inflation data from the eurozone. The Euro (EUR) is likely to trade in a sideways range of 1.0710/1.0760, UOB Group analysts note. The EUR/USD hovers near $1.0715 ahead of crucial Eurozone inflation figures and Powell's upcoming remarks. EUR/USD edges lower but holds the crucial support of 1.0700 in Tuesday's European session, correcting down from a more than two-week high near 1.0770 recorded on Monday. The major currency pair is expected to remain volatile as investors shift focus to the preliminary Eurozone Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data for June, which will be published at 09:00 GMT. EUR/USD halts its three-day winning streak, trading around 1.0730 during the Asian hours on Monday. A technical analysis of the daily chart indicates a bearish bias, with the pair consolidating within a descending channel. The pair opened with a gap higher to start the week, following the first round of French elections over the weekend.

Traders focus on falling Treasury yields after the release of the weaker-than-expected report. The Euro (EUR) dipped in London morning yesterday as the release of CPI estimate shows inflation slows. But losses were more than retraced into gains following the US Dollar (USD) pullback (on Powell's comments), OCBC strategists Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong note. Today is the last day of the Sintra summit, which will include comments by ECB's Lagarde, Luis de Guindos, Piero Cipollone, Philip Lane and Klaas Knot, ING's FX strategist Francesco Pesole notes. EUR/USD is rallying toward the key 1.0800 level that could set the tone for the rest of the month ahead of the NFP report. The EUR/USD weighs heavy weighting on the DXY.

It is too early to determine if it can reach the major resistance at 1.0850, UOB Group analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia note. After a bit of a stutter following the opening gap higher on Monday, the pair is making up for that now in a push towards 1.0800.

A coalition minority government win in France kept a financially-disastrous far right party out of the leadership race after a strong upset in earlier European Parliamentary elections. In the month of June, the ECB cut rates while the Fed pushed their forecast in a more-hawkish direction. But, you might not know that by simply looking at the chart, as EUR/USD has pushed seven consecutive days of strength to trade at its highest level since before the ECB rate cut. The Euro (EUR) started the week on a slightly softer footing after 2nd round election results produced a somewhat surprise outcome, OCBC FX analysts Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong note.

Rising market hopes for an accelerated pace of rate cuts has left market sentiment on the high side heading into the Friday market session. Forex traders prepare for rate cuts as U.S. inflation missed analyst estimates. EUR/USD strength has continued with the pair pushing up to a fresh monthly high, but the fireworks from CPI this morning have been in the Yen with EUR/JPY posing a strong snap back in the bullish trend. The euro rallied early on Thursday as the Consumer Price Index numbers in the United States has come out lower than expected. With this, traders are trying to price in the idea of a couple of potential rate cuts coming from the Federal Reserve. The Euro managed to hit target of 1.0850 today as projected last Friday. The market is facing the resistance trend on the Triangle pattern around 1.0890-1.0915, which if prices fail to break, then another drop toward 1.0700 will be expected. Deutsche Bank looks at US elections and the implications of a Trump victory in November. The Euro to Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate has been relatively stable around 1.08, but the bank expects trade policies would trigger a slide to parity. The sustainability of the US disinflationary trajectory towards the Fed's 2% inflation target will be tested today with the release of the June CPI indicator. The latest rate cut probabilities on the CME Fed Watch tool for September indicate a 68% chance for a target rate between 5.00 – 5.25% and a 3.3% chance for a target rate between 4.75 – 5.00%.

EURUSD still finds strong support at 1.0800 AUDUSD posts new 6-month high GBPJPY records extraordinary bullish rally towards uncharted levels EUR/USD posts a fresh one-month high at around  1.0850 in Thursday's European session. The major currency pair strengthens as the US Dollar (USD) is facing selling pressure due to firm expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will start reducing interest rates in September. Risk appears to be tilted to the upside; it remains to be seen if it can break clearly above 1.0850. Risk of the Euro (EUR) breaking above 1.0850 has increased, albeit moderately, UOB Group FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia note. On the hourly chart of EUR/USD at FXOpen, the pair started a fresh increase from the 1.0710 zone. The Euro cleared a few key hurdles near 1.0780 to move into a positive zone against the US Dollar. The Dollar Index nears $105, while traders closely watch US CPI data, impacting EUR and GBP. The EUR/USD pair attracts buyers for the second successive day on Thursday and moves back closer to a nearly four-week high touched on Monday. Spot prices, however, remain below mid-1.0800s as traders await the release of the US consumer inflation figures before placing fresh directional bets. With US economic data souring and the Citi Inflation Surprise Index (CISI) remaining stagnant, I'm inclined to suspect a downside surprise for core inflation, if there is to be one at all. Yet the consensus is for core CPI to remain flat at 3.4% y/y and 0.2% m/m. On Wednesday, the EURUSD pair remained steady around 1.0820, confined within a narrow range as the US Dollar continued its subdued trend. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony before Congress did little to provide clear market direction, despite his return to a hawkish stance on monetary policy.",1.08728,1.09112,1.08631,1.08728,1

Traders are weighing their stance on the Greenback as Fedspeak dominated investor sentiment with appearances from key policymakers on Monday. The US Dollar extended its Q3 sell-off last week with another push on the Thursday release of US CPI data. Inflation showed another iteration of progress, and this pushed rate cuts bets in the US, with markets now expecting three rate cuts by the end of the year to a current probability of 57.7%, as of this writing. The American currency is trying to rebound after the recent pullback. The EUR/USD poked its head above the June high of 1.0916 to reach its best level since March, after the US Empire State Manufacturing Index came out weaker than expected earlier. The US dollar has remained under pressure against most major currencies, albeit not so much against the likes of the New Zealand dollar following last week's dovish RBNZ meeting. In this webinar we take an in-depth look at the technical trade levels for the US Dollar (DXY), Euro (EUR/USD), British Pound (GBP/USD), GBP/JPY, Australian Dollar (AUD/USD), Canadian Dollar (USD/CAD), Japanese Yen (USD/JPY), Bitcoin (BTC/USD), Swiss Franc (USD/CHF), Gold (XAU/USD), Crude Oil (WTI), 10yr Treasury Yields,  S&P 500 (SPX500), Nasdaq (NDX) and the Dow Jones (DJI). These are the levels that matter on the technical charts heading into the weekly open. As we predicted two weeks ago and as we see on our previous chart, the market is facing a resistance triangle formation around 1.0890-1.0915. If prices fail to break above this resistance, then another drop toward 1.0700 will be expected Above 1.0915 more advance toward 1.1130 will be likely. The Euro (EUR) retains a firm undertone. Minor dips to the upper 1.08s were well-supported in overnight trade and spot has regained the low 1.09 area fairly easily through European trade to trade to a marginal new, short-term high (highest since March), Scotiabank's chief FX strategist Shaun Osborne notes. The euro has been bullish lately, but the Monday session shows that there is a significant amount of noise just above that could cause some issues. With this, we are expecting to see a lot of noisy behavior. It was a shocking weekend of a failed assassination attempt against Donald Trump, which caused a heated moment in the US political landscape. Despite that, the US dollar gained only moderately on safety bits, leading the non-yielding gold slightly to the downside as Biden and Trump called for unity. Gains by EURUSD slowed down on Monday after Trump's shooting over the weekend and Israel's Gaza airstrikes raised the dollar's risk premium. EUR/USD has risen above 1.09 ahead of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's speech and as strength in the dollar faded following an earlier spike higher after an assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump over the weekend. EUR/USD bounce has extended beyond 200-DMA. The pair is inching towards 1.0915/1.0980 (an important hurdle), Societe Generale FX strategists note. The EUR/USD pair refreshes a three-week high slightly above the round-level figure of 1.0900 in Monday's European session. Sheer strength in the major currency pair is driven by strong possibility of the Federal Reserve (Fed) to begin reducing interest rates from the September meeting and improved appeal of the Euro ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) policy meeting, which is scheduled for Thursday. There is a lot to digest from the shocking assassination attempt on former President Trump over the weekend. US politics, which was already very divided, has now been marred with violence, Rabobank's senior FX strategist Jane Foley notes. The Euro (EUR) is expected to trade in a range in the short run, likely between 1.0855 and 1.0905. In the longer run, EUR is expected to continue to rise, but it might take a while before 1.0915 comes into view, UOB Group FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann note. Should the latest upleg strengthen, the price could initially challenge the June peak of 1.0915. Claiming that barricade, the bulls could attack 1.0975, which is the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 1.0447-1.1138 upleg. The Dollar Index rebounds to $104.25, sparking questions about future trends for EUR/USD and GBP/USD amid mixed economic data. The EUR/USD pair attracts some sellers on the first day of a new week and for now, seems to have snapped a three-day winning streak to over a one-month peak, around the 1.0910 area touched on Friday. Spot prices currently trade below the 1.0900 mark amid a modest US Dollar (USD) uptick, though any meaningful corrective decline seems elusive. The Euro started a steady increase above the 1.0800 level against the US Dollar. EUR/USD cleared the 1.0820 and 1.0850 resistance levels to enter a positive zone. The tide has most certainly been turning against USD bulls, with weak US economic data vindicating dovish market pricing despite the Fed pushing back against a September cut. The US dollar index was lower for a second week and down around 2% from the June high, but there could be further losses ahead if data continues to sour.

Markets have fully priced in the start of a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate-cutting cycle in September, with up to three quarter-point cuts expected for the year. The US Dollar had a harsh start to Q3 as the currency continued to sell-off from the 106.00 handle in DXY. As looked at yesterday, the USD was red for ten of 12 days, including a large push last Thursday after the release of US CPI data. The pullback in Treasury yields did not put pressure on the American currency. Germany's ZEW Survey for July reflected slightly weaker expectations among investors. The Euro (EUR) is trading around the 1.09 area, supported by the recent compression in short-term yield spreads, Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne. The euro has been very choppy over the last couple of days as we continue to hang around each big figure on the chart. All things being equal, we are the top of the major consolidation area, so it'll be interesting to see what happens next. According to the EUR/USD chart, the euro to dollar exchange rate yesterday surpassed the peak from early June, rising above 1.092 – the last time the price was at this level was on March 21. EUR/USD hovers in a tight range near the round-level figure of 1.0900 in Tuesday's European session as the upside move stalls with a focus on Thursday's European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy meeting. The major currency pair is broadly firm as investors expect the ECB will not deliver subsequent rate cuts. The Euro (EUR) is expected to trade in a range, likely between 1.0875 and 1.0915. Upward momentum is slowing; it remains to be seen if EUR can rise further to 1.0940, UOB Group FX strategists Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann note.

Broad-market risk appetite remains pinned into the ceiling as markets fully price in a rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) on September 18. Traders stay bearish on U.S. dollar as they prepare for the start of the Fed rate cut cycle. The Euro managed to break above 1.0915 today which could set off another advance as previously predicted. As we see on the daily chart, prices now face a 1.0860 support level. The Euro (EUR) is firmer versus the US Dollar (USD), rising through the low 1.09 area that had capped gains in the past few weeks to reach its highest level since March, Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne notes. The EUR/USD has been on the rise in the last few days, nearing its highest levels since March after breaking above the 1.0900 handle. The rebound is primarily attributed to a weakening US dollar, despite mixed economic data from the United States. The euro rose in the early hours of Wednesday, as the market is now able to clear the 1.09 level. As before, I still believe that the market is going to continue to bounce around between the big figures. EUR/USD continued its advance above the 1.0900 handle this morning as eurozone inflation matched the consensus and first estimates. An accelerated selloff in the DXY has also benefited EUR/USD, as traders increase their bets on rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve, putting pressure on the US Dollar. EUR/USD jumps above 1.0900 and reaches a new four-month high in Wednesday's European session. The major currency pair extends gains after recovering its losses on Tuesday, driven by the better-than-expected United States (US) Retail Sales report for June.

An uptick in weekly US jobless claims helped to further support hopes for a September rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed), while the European Central Bank (ECB) balked in the face of lopsided economic data and opted to keep rates on hold for the time being. It's been a strong month of price action for EUR/USD. It was in mid-June on the heels of the FOMC meeting that the pair was hurdling down towards longer-term range support, and that level was clearly marked as the 38.2% retracement of the 2021-2022 major move in the pair. EUR/USD is moving lower as traders react to ECB Interest Rate Decision. EURUSD eases further from new multi-week high (1.0948) as markets digested ECB's decision to stay on hold and repeat its mantra that future action will be dependent on incoming economic data. As we predicted yesterday and as we see on our previous chart, the Euro managed to break above 1.0915 which could set another advance course. On the Daily chart, the market is now facing the 1.0860 support level. The euro has edged lower on Thursday. Early in the North American session, EUR/USD is trading at 1.0919, down 0.18% on the day. The ECB meeting has come and gone, and at this point in time, the market is likely to pull back just a bit. However, this is a market that is choppy and sideways at best. As universally expected, the ECB left its policy rates on hold at today's meeting. The tone of the statement was roughly unchanged, but there were some growing signs of caution on the growth and employment outlooks, and the GC appears to be looking through the recent strength in underlying inflation, TDS FX analysts note. EUR/USD appreciated by 2.1% to 1.0940 so far in July from its trendline support near 1.07, DBS senior FX strategist Philip Wee. The European Central Bank left policy rates unchanged earlier, inline with market expectations, with the September meeting, and updated staff projections, now key. The Euro (EUR) has drifted a little lower over the session so far but losses are marginal ahead of the ECB policy decision, Scotiabank's chief FX strategist Shaun Osborne notes. ECB policymakers are expected to provide hints on the Eurozone interest rate trajectory, and this will likely be the highlight for EURUSD. Rejuvenated momentum suggests further Euro (EUR) strength. EUR could test but is unlikely to break clearly above the significant resistance zone between 1.0970 and 1.0980, UOB Group FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann note. The price has been displaying a pattern of higher highs and higher lows in the past three weeks, but its failure to reach the upper band of the bullish channel on the four-hour chart could indicate a bearish wave approaching. Besides, considering the negative turn in the RSI and the stochastic oscillator, some weakness in the near term cannot be excluded. The Dollar Index (DXY) climbed to $103.75, raising questions about potential buying opportunities as U.S. economic optimism drives the currency. EUR/USD turns sideways in Thursday's European session after rallying to a fresh four-month high at around 1.0950 on Wednesday. The major currency pair is expected to remain quiet as investors shift to the sidelines ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) policy meeting, which will be announced at 12:15 GMT.

That remains a key zone for the currency, as this is the same spot that held the lows in Q2 and the fact that the bounce took place after the European Central Bank rate decision, when EUR/USD tested a key Fibonacci level, makes the move all the more interesting. EURUSD was on a three-week winning streak three sessions ago, and the US PCE data could have far-reaching impact on the pair this week.

The early hours of Monday have seen the Euro struggle with the proper direction in the early hours of Monday. Despite the fact that the US has seen Joe Biden drop out of the race, the dollar has been relatively steady. Rising 10DMA and Fibo 23.6% of 1.0666/1.0948 (1.0881) contained dips for now, signaling a scenario of shallow correction before larger bulls regain control. The evolving political landscape, with nearly four months until the election, could impact markets in various ways given the notable differences in the agendas of Harris and Trump. The Euro (EUR) strength has ended; for the time being, it is likely to trade in a range between 1.0845 and 1.0945, UOB Group FX strategists Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia note.

At the start of this webinar there was a USD item setting up, as DXY was nearing a test of a key point of resistance. After last week's webinar, bears were able to extend the move below 104.00, but they couldn't hold it for long. EUR/USD pulls back ahead of the March high (1.0981) to keep the Relative Strength Index (RSI) out of overbought territory, but data prints coming out of the US may curb the recent weakness in the exchange rate as the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index is anticipated to show slowing inflation. The weaker-than-expected Existing Home Sales report did not put pressure on the American currency. The euro is continuing to find itself attracted to the big figures at the moment, as we are simply bouncing back and forth in this pair. Keep in mind that this is also an indicator of what the US dollar is going to be doing overall. Encouraging Eurozone disinflationary process leaves the ECB room to cut the policy rate again in September which remains a headwind for the Euro (EUR), BBH analysts note. Attention is now on eurozone consumer confidence data, which is expected to improve slightly to -13.2, up from -14. The slight improvement in morale comes as the ECB cut interest rates in June by 25 basis points. EUR/USD retraces its recent gains, trading around 1.0870 during the European session on Tuesday. Traders are likely awaiting the release of the leading Consumer Confidence data by the European Commission (EC) later in the day, which is expected to indicate an economic downturn with an expected reading of -13.2 for July, in comparison with the previous -14.0 reading. Euro (EUR) strength has ended; for the time being, it is likely to trade in a range between 1.0845 and 1.0945, UOB Group FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann notes. The Dollar Index (DXY) is holding strong above $104, signaling potential further gains amid upcoming economic data releases. EUR/USD advances for the second consecutive day, trading around 1.0900 during Tuesday's Asian session. The analysis of the daily chart shows a weakening of a bullish trend, as the pair is positioned below an ascending channel. EUR/USD churned on Monday just below 1.0900 as the new trading week kicks things off on a notably light note. Meaningful data remains limited for the first half of the trading week, leaving Fiber traders to shuffle in place as investors await Wednesday's key Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) figures for both the EU and the US.",1.08507,1.08665,1.08267,1.08507,0

The euro continues to see a lot of noise, but at this point in time, it is obvious that the pair is being supported by traders on the idea that we are going to go back and forth between large, round significant numbers. The EURUSD recovered some upside momentum on Monday, but PMI figures from the US and the Eurozone will likely push a breakout to Thursday. The euro edged lower on Wednesday but has recovered. In the North American session, EUR/USD is trading at 1.0860, up 0.07% on the day at the time of writing. Soft and softer than expected preliminary Eurozone PMI data for July weighed on the Euro (EUR) earlier. EUR losses may be steadying ahead of a mass of support in the low 1.08s, Scotiabank's chief FX strategist Shaun Osborne notes. While the euro has struggled, the Japanese yen continues to roar back higher. The strengthening yen is a reflection of tightening of bond yield spread between Japan and the rest of the world, after ballooning following the years of excessive expansionary monetary policy in Japan while the rest of the world pursued a sharp contractionary policy to combat surging inflation. EURUSD extended pullback from a multi-month high (1.0948) and cracked pivotal supports at 1.0840/33 (Fibo 38.2% of 1.0666/1.0948 / 20DMA) but struggling to make a clear break lower. Last week European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde emphasized the data dependency of future interest rate decisions. Of course, inflation data comes first, Commerzbank FX strategist Antje Praefcke notes. The Japanese yen has risen to a monthly high against the US dollar, boosted by a mix of positive economic data, short covering, and safe-haven flows. EUR/USD weakens to near 1.0830 in Wednesday's European session as the preliminary Eurozone Hamburg Commercial Bank (HCOB) Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) report for July showed that Composite numbers unexpectedly eased due to a slowdown in activities in the manufacturing as well as the service sectors. The Euro (EUR) is likely to trade with a downward bias. Tentative buildup in momentum suggests downside risk; any further decline in EUR is unlikely to break clearly below 1.0815, UOB Group FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann. The German Composite PMI fell to a four-month low and back into contraction territory in July, strengthening the case for further rate cuts in the Euro Area. As DXY approaches $104.50, traders eye a triangle pattern, signaling potential shifts in EUR/USD and GBP/USD. On the hourly chart of EUR/USD at FXOpen, the pair failed to clear the 1.0950 resistance. The Euro started a fresh decline below the 1.0900 support against the US Dollar. The EUR/USD pair prolongs its recent corrective slide from the vicinity of mid-1.0900s, or a four-month high touched last week, and remains under some selling pressure for the second straight day on Wednesday. This also marks the fourth day of a negative move in the previous five and drags spot prices to a nearly two-week low, around the 1.0840 region during the Asian session. EURUSD currency pair recently reversed down from the resistance area set between the multi-month resistance level 1.0920 (which has been reversing the price from the start of this year), upper daily Bollinger Band and the 61.8% Fibonacci correction of the downward wave B from December.",1.08395,1.08644,1.08293,1.08395,1

Broad-market expectations for a September rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) are still pinned to the ceiling, but there's nowhere to go but down as US data continues to catch investors off-guard. The encouraging GDP Growth Rate report did not provide sufficient support to the American currency. EUR/USD is trying to stage a bounce off the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the late-June to mid-July rally The Euro fell below the support 1.0860 as prices fell back inside the old triangle formation which could push for a further drop toward the 1.0700 zone. As we see on the chart and as if prices hold below 1.0870, the downtrend pressure could sustain over market and head toward 1.0700. The euro is hanging about in a range yet again, as it looks like we have nowhere to be anytime soon. With this, we need to see some kind of massive momentum shift. Managing EUR/USD is very easy at the moment: you just have to wait a little. Ultimately, the exchange rate always returns to 1.0850. The EURUSD stabilised on Thursday as investors paused their dollar appetite with multipole high-impact US macroeconomic data in sight. EUR/USD rebounds to near 1.0850 in Thursday's European session despite the near-term outlook of the Euro remains uncertain due to firm expectations of more rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB) and deepening concerns over German economic prospects. Chance for the Euro (EUR) to edge lower. Any decline is still unlikely to break clearly below 1.0815. Despite mixed PMI data, EUR/USD and GBP/USD remain steady, while the DXY holds near $104.30 ahead of US GDP figures. EURUSD had been rising steadily following its bullish breakout from a downward sloping trendline in early July, posting a fresh four-month peak of 1.0947 last week. However, the pair has been experiencing a correction since then, with the price approaching the converging 50- and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs).

The Federal Reserve's (Fed) latest rate call is due on Wednesday, with another round of US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) on the books for Friday. It's been a busy couple of weeks across markets, drawing back to the US CPI report on the 11th of July. And it may not be entirely driven by that CPI report as a Bank of Japan intervention in the minutes after the release has unsettled what was previously one of the world's most consistent major market trends. Forex traders have already started to prepare for the Fed decision, which will be released on Wednesday. The Euro (EUR) is tracking a little weaker on the session but losses are limited and Euro (EUR) dips to the low 1.08 area remain well-supported, Scotiabank's chief FX strategist Shaun Osborne notes. The Euro fell below the support of 1.0860 as the market fell back inside the old triangle formation which could push for a further drop toward 1.0700. As we see on the chart and as long as the market holds below 1.0870, the downtrend pressure could sustain to head toward the 1.0700 zone. In the absence of high-impact data on Monday, July 29, 2024, market sentiment is focused on the key data releases for the week. First, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is set for Wednesday. The euro is currently stuck in a 100 pip range, and the action on Monday has done nothing to change this outlook. That being said, if you are a short-term rangebound kind of trader – this is your market. This week is a crucial one for the markets, with significant data releases, central bank meetings, and major company earnings reports set to impact indices, metals, and currencies. As we start the week, the EUR/USD has fallen with the dollar rising across the board. This week will be one of the most exciting weeks for EUR/USD in a long time, with the first estimate of euro area Q2 GDP due Tuesday, followed by euro area July inflation and the Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting on Wednesday, and US payrolls on Friday, Commerzbank's FX analyst Michael Pfister notes. The Euro (EUR) is expected to trade sideways, probably in a range of 1.0835/1.0870. EUR is likely to trade with a downward bias; the 1.0815 level is expected to provide solid support, UOB Group FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia note. As DXY surges to $104.45, traders watch EUR/USD and GBP/USD closely. Upcoming economic data may spark major market shifts. EUR/USD trades in a tight range near 1.0850 in Monday's European session. The major currency pair struggles for direction as investors have sidelined ahead of the Eurozone preliminary Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for July and the Federal Reserve's (Fed) monetary policy announcement on Wednesday. EUR/USD advances for the third consecutive day, trading around 1.0860 during the Asian session on Monday.  The analysis of the daily chart shows that the pair is positioned within a descending channel, suggesting a bearish bias. Looking at the 4-hour chart, the pair tested the 1.0825 support zone and remained stable above the 200 simple moving average (green, 4-hour). A low was formed at 1.0825 and the pair is now rising.

Ultimately, this is a market that seemingly is alright with going from one large figure to another, in a lackluster way. The whole world is just waiting to see what the Federal Reserve decides and what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says (or doesn't say) in the press conference, Commerzbank's FX strategist Antje Praefcke notes.

The slow race to September's Fed rate call kicks off on Friday with the latest print of US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) for July. EUR/USD is churning chart paper near 1.0800 after the Federal Reserve (Fed) struck a notably measured tone regarding interest rates on Wednesday. Shifts in Monetary Policy Report language were much less confident on rate cut expectations than many market participants had been hoping for, with cautious tones about inflation and upbeat employment expectations miring odds of a quarter-point trim in September. Treasury yields are falling ahead of the Fed decision, which is bearish for the American currency. Market participants are approaching today's FOMC meeting with numerous questions. The previous FOMC meeting was bullish for the US dollar as the Fed updated its projections to include one rate cut in 2024. Euro is on defense for a third consecutive week with EUR/USD trading just above weekly technical support on Wednesday. The battle lines are drawn heading into the August open with the FOMC interest rate decision and Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) on tap into the close of the week. The Euro fell below the support 1.0860 as prices fell back inside the old triangle formation which could push toward the 1.0700 zone. As we see on the chart and as long as market holds below 1.0870 then the downtrend pressure could sustain and head toward 1.0700. EURUSD bounced on Wednesday after a triple rejection at 1.0800 support zone (50% retracement of 1.0666/1.0948 rally/daily Kijun-sen) signals formation of a bear-trap. The euro bounced a bit in the early hours of Wednesday, as the world awaits the Federal Reserve meeting. Ultimately, this is a market that remains somewhat neutral, and rangebound. This morning's release of stronger-than-expected Eurozone CPI has made a September rate cut from the ECB a close call, helping to ease the pressure on the single currency. The euro gained ground against most majors except the yen with the latter surging on the back of the Bank of Japan's surprise 15 basis point rate hike overnight. The EUR/USD pair moves higher to near 1.0830 in Wednesday's European session. The major currency pair rises as price pressures in Eurozone grew at a faster-than-expected pace in July. There is a chance for the Euro (EUR) to dip to 1.0790 before the risk of a more sustained rebound increases. The major support at 1.0760 is unlikely to come under threat, UOB Group FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann note. The Dollar Index sits at 104.406, testing key support levels. Can the uptrend hold amid market volatility? While the BOJ hiked more aggressively than expected, they fell short on their ETF tapering, rattling the yen during a bout of 2-way volatility.

The euro has been all over the place in the early hours on Monday, as traders are trying to do everything they can to figure out what the possibility of Federal Reserve cuts will do to the markets in general. On one hand, this was driven by the weakness of the dollar. The USD fell sharply against other currencies following the release of labour market news on Friday (data from ForexFactory hereafter): On the build-up of Fed rate cut speculation, EUR/USD has risen to a 5-month high and towards the top of the trading range that has dominated all year.

Market turbulence often presents lots of opportunities, but there is still excess froth to be shed as the unwinding of leveraged carry trades persists for now. The EUR/USD was trading lower along with gold and major European indices in the first half of Tuesday's session. EUR/USD retreats back to 1.09, shedding 100 pips since its peak performance on Monday at 1.1008, when it added another tranche of gains at the beginning of the week to its stellar move following the poor US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Friday. Markets were spooked by recession fears, sparking an equity crisis in Asia where the two major Japanese indices, the Nikkei and the Topix, lost over 10% of value in just one trading day. Provided that the Euro (EUR) remains above 1.0910, it could retest the 1.1010 level before another pullback is likely. EUR is still positive, but it has to surpass 1.1010 before further advance to 1.1070 can be expected, UOB Group FX strategists Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann note. Despite mixed European data, EUR/USD maintains bullish momentum, while Dollar Index rises to 102.911 amid economic uncertainty. EUR/USD weakens near 1.0950 on the recovery of US Dollar, eyes on Eurozone Retail Sales data EUR/USD scrambled for higher ground on Monday, launching bids into 1.1000 before settling back into a familiar range near 1.0950 and failing to set a fresh high for 2024. Broad-market expectations for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve (Fed) have run well ahead of the curve, with investors hoping for an initial double-cut from the Fed in September.",1.09262,1.09364,1.09069,1.09262,1

EUR/USD flubbed a bullish dash for 1.1000, leaving bids hung out to dry. EUR/USD holds within the broad range from the first half of the year as the recent rally in the exchange rate seems to have stalled ahead of the January high (1.1046). USD/JPY is up by more than 2% after BoJ calmed markets. The euro has continues to see a lot of sideways action overall, with the EUR/USD pair seemingly doing everything it can to reach big figures time and time again. The Euro (EUR) is holding a relatively tight trading range in the low 1.09 area, Scotiabank's chief FX strategist Shaun Osborne notes. The Euro (EUR) is expected to consolidate between 1.0895 and 1.0960. EUR is still positive, but it has to surpass 1.1010 before further advance to 1.1070 can be expected, UOB Group FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann notes. The EUR/USD pair remains under some selling pressure for the second straight day on Wednesday, albeit manages to hold its neck above the 1.0900 mark through the early European session. The downtick is sponsored by the emergence of some US Dollar (USD) buying, though the fundamental backdrop warrants caution before positioning for an extension of this week's pullback from the 1.1000 psychological mark, or a seven-month peak. With the Dollar Index surging to $103.24, analysts debate whether it's the ideal moment to invest amidst bullish market sentiment.

Fiber flubbed a swing for the 1.1000 handle earlier this week, and momentum has drained out of the pair as investors continue to cool off after a surge of panic after last Friday's misfire in US labor data. The American currency continues to rebound after the recent sell-off. The Euro managed to test the resistance 1.1000 and remained below this resistance. If prices hold below 1.1000, another drop toward 1.0800 will be expected. EUR/USD has edged back from its earlier high but trades all but unchanged on the day, FX chief FX strategist Shaun Osborne notes. The EUR/USD pair continues to be very sideways during the early hours of Thursday, as the market continues to look for some kind of momentum. This is a fight between two central banks that are more likely than not going to race to the bottom. As mentioned above, it is not quite clear yet that this corrective phase in equity markets is over. If it is, our view is that EUR/USD can reconnect with the sharp narrowing in eurozone:US interest rate differentials and can start trading over 1.10, ING's FX strategist Chris Turner notes. EURUSD is struggling to break above 1.0950 despite the impending Fed rate cuts, and US Initial Jobless Claims could raise stakes. EUR/USD edges higher to near 1.0940 in Thursday's European session. The major currency pair rises as the US Dollar corrects from a three-day high. With the VIX reversing down, market volatility has neutralized as we head into US CPI week. The volatile wave between US recession fears and the Japanese rate hike has stabilized for now, with insights awaited from FOMC member speeches regarding the timing and magnitude of the next rate cut. The Euro (EUR) is expected to edge higher; the 1.0960 level is expected to offer strong resistance. But EUR has to surpass 1.1010 before further advance to 1.1070 can be expected, UOB Group FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann note.

US Producer Price Index (PPI) business-level inflation figures are on the docket for Tuesday, and markets are hoping for a continued easing in structural inflation pressures. EUR/USD has been range-bound for more than 19 months now; and for the past 12 months, the pair has seen that range narrowing in the form of a symmetrical triangle. Forex traders are not ready for big moves ahead of PPI data, which will be released tomorrow. The Euro managed to test the resistance at 1.1000 and managed to keep below this level so far. As we see on our previous chart, if prices remain below 1.100,0 another drop toward 1.0800 will be expected. The EUR/USD pair is one that doesn't really have anywhere to be soon. However, this is a pair that has a couple of short term based levels that are worth paying attention to in order to get the next 50 to 100 pips correct. There were no major data reports today and, with central bankers on the beach, there have been no comments from policy makers, Scotiabank chief FX strategist Shaun Osborne notes. Financial markets have taken the view that the Federal Reserve has left it too late to cut rates and that a US recession is likely, ING's FX analysts Francesco Pesole and Chris Turner note. EURUSD, Silver Outlook: with the sharp rebound of the US Dollar, EURUSD is facing bearish pressures below the 1.10 mark, whereas Silver is rising alongside global commodities. The Euro (EUR) is likely to consolidate between 1.0895 and 1.0930. If EUR breaches 1.0875, it would mean that the likelihood of it rising to 1.1010 has faded, UOB Group FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia note. EUR/USD stays in a tight range above the round-level support of 1.0900 in Monday's European session. The major currency pair struggles for direction as investors look for fresh cues at the start of a busy data week that will likely indicate how much the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates in September. As the Dollar Index approaches $103, traders are closely watching whether it will trigger a bullish breakout or face a bearish reversal. EUR/USD Price Forecast: 1.1000 appears to be a tough nut to crack for buyers The Euro started a downside correction from the 1.1000 resistance zone against the US Dollar. EUR/USD could start another increase if it clears the 1.0950 resistance. EUR/USD halts its four-day losing streak, trading around 1.0920 during the Asian session on Monday.

Fiber traders still await pan-EU Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth numbers slated for early Wednesday, but investors will be broadly focused on upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation figures as risk appetite extends into recovery mode. Forex traders bet on dovish Fed as PPI report missed analyst expectations. The US Dollar may continue to face headwinds ahead of the Fed rate decision on September 18 as the US CPI is also anticipated to show a slowdown in July. The euro continues to see a lot of sideways action overall, as we don't really seem to have a lot of momentum in one direction or another. Ultimately, this is a situation where traders are looking at two central banks that are both going to be loose. The ZEW economic outlook turned sharply lower in August with economic expectations declining at their fastest rate in two years. Germany's ZEW Investor Expectations Survey fell to 19.2 in August, weaker than expected and well down from July's 41.8 read, Scotiabank's chief FX strategist Shaun Osborne notes. The EUR/USD edged lower on the back of sentiment data showing a sharp drop in investor optimism, although the losses were contained with investors awaiting the release of the first of the two key US inflation reports this week: PPI today and CPI tomorrow. This week's inflation data is likely to have a much larger influence on the EUR/USD forecast than Eurozone data. EURUSD is holding within a narrow congestion, capped by Fibo resistance at 1.0933 (Fibo 61.8% of 1.1139/1.0601), as markets slowed ahead of key release this week – US inflation report. The Euro (EUR) could edge higher; as upward momentum is not strong, any advance is unlikely to break above 1.0960. If EUR breaches 1.0875, it would mean that the likelihood of it rising to 1.1010 has faded, UOB Group FX strategists Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia note. EUR/USD edges slightly lower but holds the key support level of 1.0900 in Tuesday's European session. The major currency pair trades broadly sideways as investors appear to be sidelined ahead of the United States (US) Producer Price Index (PPI) data, which will be published at 12:30 GMT. EURUSD continues to face restrictions near the 1.0940 level and the resistance trendline from July 2023, which squeezed the price below a seven-month low of 1.1007 last week. As the DXY consolidates, traders are on edge, watching for a breakout that could reshape the EUR/USD and GBP/USD dynamics. The EUR/USD pair trades in positive territory around 1.0940 during the Asian session on Tuesday.

Fiber caught a run over 1.1000 and into the 1.1050 level after pan-EU Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth figure printed exactly as expected. Forex traders bet on dovish Fed, which is bearish for the American currency. A technical breakout takes Euro into the first major resistance hurdle at the yearly highs. Battle lines drawn on the EUR/USD short-term technical charts. The Euro managed to pass above the 1.1000 level which could give a push for more advance. The Intraday levels show a possible uptrend channel which could have resistance around 1.1030-50 and support at 1.0890. The euro broke above the crucial 1.10 level in the early hours of the Wednesday session, and therefore it looks even more bullish. However, the CPI numbers are coming, and they will have a direct effect on how this pair moves going forward. The Euro (EUR) is trading at its highest since January as markets anticipate US CPI data coming in soft enough to prompt the Fed to make rapid rate cuts in the coming months, Scotiabank's chief FX strategist Shaun Osborne notes. With industrial data remaining weak in the Eurozone and after a dismal ZEW survey for Germany yesterday, you might be wondering what on earth are FX traders smoking by bidding up the EUR/USD? The Euro (EUR) is expected to move higher and could break above last week's high near 1.1010; the next resistance at 1.1050 is likely out of reach. After that, the next level to watch is 1.1070, UOB Group FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann note. EUR/USD clings to gains around the psychological resistance of 1.1000 in Wednesday's European session, its highest level in around seven months. The major currency pair strengthens as the near-term outlook of the US Dollar (USD) is subdued due to firm speculation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will start reducing interest rates in September. The latest statement from FOMC member Raphael Bostic emphasized the need for more data before confidently initiating the easing of monetary policy. With this sentiment echoed repeatedly in recent headlines, today's US CPI result will be pivotal in confirming the path towards a rate cut or signaling caution against it. EURUSD, Gold Analysis: EURUSD and Gold are both hovering near significant resistance levels ahead of today's US CPI release. The question remains: Are they forming reversal patterns, or are they on the brink of a breakout?

US Retail Sales growth lurched to an 18-month high of 1.0% MoM in July, well above the forecast 0.3% and entirely engulfing the previous month's -0.2% contraction. EUR/USD put in a strong breakout on the back of CPI, but has since snapped back as US Dollar strength began to re-appear. This sets up another key test at the 1.1000 level even after the breakout of the symmetrical triangle pattern. The strong Retail Sales report pushed Treasury yields higher, which was bullish for the American currency. The euro continues to go back and forth between the large round numbers time and time again, and Thursday shows that people are still using the levels of 1.09, 1.10, 1.11, and so on for guideposts in what is typically a very neutral pair. After touching its highest level in 2024 near 1.1050 on Wednesday, EUR/USD went into a consolidation phase during the European trading hours on Thursday. With the latest macroeconomic data releases from the US providing a boost to the USD, however, the pair lost its footing and slumped below 1.1000. The Euro (EUR) is steady on the session and looks quite comfortable trading on a 1.10 handle. The eurozone economy does not have a lot to shout about at the moment. And a rebound in the Chinese economy remains elusive, ING's FX strategist Chris Turner notes. The EUR/USD pair trades in a tight range above the psychological support of 1.1000 in Thursday's European session. The major currency pair faces slight profit-booking after posting a fresh more than seven-month high at 1.1050. The Dollar Index (DXY) remains steady at $102.57 as traders await U.S. Retail Sales data, which could drive the next market move. The Euro (EUR) is likely to trade in a sideways range of 1.0985/1.1045. Upward momentum has been rejuvenated. It looked like the pair was on for a break yesterday after the US CPI report but the dollar didn't end up weakening too significantly. Since then, price action has been a little tight for EUR/USD, with today's range a measly 12 pips so far between 1.1003 to 1.1015.

The Fiber was bolstered cleanly above 1.1050 and is headed firmly for a retest of the 1.1100 handle. In this webinar we take an in-depth look at the technical trade levels for the US Dollar (DXY), Euro (EUR/USD), British Pound (GBP/USD), Australian Dollar (AUD/USD), Canadian Dollar (USD/CAD), Japanese Yen (USD/JPY), 10yr Treasury Yields, Swiss Franc (USD/CHF), EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, Gold (XAU/USD), Crude Oil (WTI), S&P 500 (SPX500), Nasdaq (NDX) and the Dow Jones (DJI). These are the levels that matter on the technical charts heading into the weekly open. Despite a barren economic calendar, the US dollar is on the retreat again to start this week. Some analysts have chalked the move up to concerns about future economic growth, and that's certainly a possibility, but one other explanation is political in nature. U.S. dollar is under strong pressure as traders bet on dovish Fed. The Euro managed to test the resistance zone of 1.1030-50 and dropped toward 1.0950 before rebounding again and testing 1.1030-50. The intraday levels show a possible uptrend channel which still has resistance around 1.1030-50 and support at 1.0890. Gold surges and EUR/USD rises as markets anticipate Fed rate cuts. Powell's upcoming Jackson Hole speech could shape the U.S. Dollar's next move. EUR/USD reached a marginal new high barely above 1.1050 earlier, reflecting broader USD losses and little else, Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne notes. The euro continues to grind away overall, as the markets are positive, but obviously a little stretched. At this point, I suspect we are looking at the market through the prism of one that will continue to revisit the 19,500 region. EURUSD keeps firm tone at the start of the week and extends gains above psychological 1.10 barrier after registering a weekly close above this level for the first time since late December. The Dollar Index (DXY) is under pressure, down 0.24%, with critical support at $102.166, signaling potential further declines. EURUSD has been in a bullish move, especially after the rally above the long-term symmetrical triangle last week. The pair is again battling with the almost eight-month high of 1.1050, with the simple moving averages (SMAs) mirroring the current upside movement as they are all ticking higher. EUR/USD strengthens to near YTD top below 1.1050 on firm Fed rate cut prospects EUR/USD extends its gains for the second successive session, trading around 1.1030 during the Asian hours on Monday. The upside of the pair could be attributed to the rising odds of an interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) starting in September. With little fresh information on the calendar to shift economic sentiment, it's debatable how much near-term downside is left for the US dollar index (DXY) outside an unlikely extremely dovish tone from Fed speakers at the Jackson Hole symposium. That puts greater emphasis on the price action to dictate direction, meaning technicals and performance of the largest components in the DXY – EUR and JPY – will be important for traders to monitor this week.",1.10865,1.11173,1.10725,1.10865,1

The pair has closed firmly in the green for three straight trading days, and is on pace to climb a full percent since Monday's opening bids. I started off the webinar with a look at gold and spot XAU/USD has shown a strong breakout to surge through the $2,500 level. As I shared then, this is a difficult spot for establishing bullish exposure and while the early-day strength was attractive, it's still a move that I'm reticent to chase. Traders expect that Fed will cut rates aggressively to provide additional support to the economy. Through most of this year, EUR/USD has been contained by a 1.10 to 1.06 range. During the past few sessions, the currency pair has mostly held levels above 1.10 which raises the question as to whether a new range is being drawn out, Rabobank's Senior FX Strategist Jane Foley notes. The Euro broke above 1.1050 and continues to as projected last week as the next resistance is towards 1.1140. The market could head for a drop to 1.1140 with support at 1.1030-50 before advancing again. The euro continues to see buyers on Tuesday, but at this point, we are close to the crucial 1.11 level, an area that has been resistant for almost two years. Can we continue to drive higher? Euro/dollar maintains its position close to a seven-month peak, trading at 1.1077 on Tuesday. The US dollar's weakening continues, largely driven by market expectations of an imminent interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve next month. The Euro (EUR) is showing a marginal loss on the day on the screens but EUR/USD has essentially moved sideways in a narrow range overnight as the market consolidates around the EUR's highest point since the start of the year, Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne notes. Fundamentals remain supportive as Eurozone trade surplus strongly widened in June and inflation remained elevated in July, signaling further gains after correction. EUR/USD trades close to a more than seven-month high slightly below the round-level resistance of 1.1100 in Tuesday's European session. The major currency pair holds gains as the US Dollar (USD) continues to face a sheer sell-off, weighed by firm expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will begin cutting interest rates in September. EUR/USD continues to grind higher without much news. At the heart of the story is whether EUR/USD will break out of an 18-month trading range, which has largely contained EUR/USD between 1.05 and 1.11, ING's FX strategist Chris Turner notes. As the Dollar Index climbs 0.13%, traders should monitor the $101.78 pivot point for a possible breakout. EUR/USD trades around 1.1080 during the Asian session on Tuesday after pulling back from an eight-month high of 1.1087. This downside is attributed to the improved US Dollar (USD) amid risk aversion sentiment.",1.11279,1.11483,1.11056,1.11279,1

Markets are selling off the Greenback across the board as investor confidence in a September rate cut rises to dizzying highs. EUR/USD bulls are feeling emboldened with the common currency surging to highs not seen since July 2023 against the US dollar. However, such has been the rush to buy the euro since the start of August, it's now sitting at extremely overbought levels on RSI (14) on the daily. EUR/USD clears the December high (1.1140) as it rallies to a fresh yearly high (1.1174), with the recent rise in the exchange rate pushing the Relative Strength Index (RSI) into overbought territory for the first time this year. EUR/USD pushed further into the high end on Wednesday, breaching 1.1150 and finding fresh 13-month highs on approach to 1.1200 as Fiber bids surges on broad Greenback weakness. The US Dollar is softer across the board in the midweek market session as investors continue to pile into bets that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will be forced to kick off a rate-cutting cycle in September. Forex traders stay focused on falling Treasury yields, which is bearish for the American currency. The single currency continues to benefit from risk appetite and weak dollar on Fed rate cut expectations, with release of FOMC minutes today, to shed more light on the depth of policy easing. The EURUSD pair hit a year-to-date high on Wednesday, but investors adopted a cautious approach ahead of FOMC meeting minutes release. The UD dollar continues to weaken ahead of today's FOMC minutes and Fed chair Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole appearance on Friday The euro continues to see a lot of resistance above, as we are stretched at this point in time. Ultimately, we are in a situation where the markets are trying to determine what the Federal Reserve is going to do going forward. EUR/USD is consolidating above 1.11 after three solid days' worth of gains to reach its highest since December, Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne notes. The single currency has risen above $1.11, almost repeating its late December peak. At current levels, the pair is within the upper boundary of its trading range, and the technical analysis suggests that a breakout is more likely than a pullback. On the hourly chart of EUR/USD at FXOpen, the pair started a fresh increase from the 1.0950 zone. The Euro cleared the 1.1000 resistance to move into a bullish zone against the US Dollar. EURUSD has been in a steady rally since August 15, when it hit support at 1.0950, and it is currently testing the key resistance zone of 1.1130, a zone that stopped the bulls from heading further north back in December, as well as back in July, 2023. Overall, the pair is trading above a short-term uptrend line drawn from the low of August 2, and well above the upper bound of a prior sideways range, at around 1.0900. The Euro (EUR) joined the Pound Sterling (GBP) in reversing this year's losses on Monday, DBS Senior FX Strategist Philip Wee notes. EUR/USD hovers near 1.1130 in Wednesday's European session, the highest level seen this year. The major currency pair aims to revisit 2024 highs of 1.1140 as the US Dollar (USD) remains under pressure amid growing optimism over Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cuts in September. With a keen interest for the markets to price in trends based on outlook expectations, positive rallies are seen besides the drop of the US dollar ahead of the insights from the FOMC minutes and Fed Powell's statement. The market is leaning toward a dovish outlook from the Fed, which Powell is expected to confirm on Friday following the insights from today's FOMC minutes release. With DXY eyeing a rebound above $101, market focus shifts to whether EUR/USD and GBP/USD will maintain their current trends or reverse course. EUR/USD holds below 1.1150 amid cautious mood, all eyes on FOMC Minutes Short Term Elliott Wave View in EURUSD suggests that pair is close to form a bullish sequence. A break above the previous high on 12.28.2023 at 1.1139 suggests the next leg higher has started.",1.11554,1.11575,1.10993,1.11554,0

At the time of writing, the major clings around the 1.1100 figure for the third straight day. It's been a brisk backdrop for EUR/USD over the past few weeks. Initially the currency pair tested a breakout from the symmetrical triangle formation in early-August. Treasury yields are rising, providing additional support to the American currency. The Euro met the target of 1.1140 and managed to hit a few pips above that resistance. As we see on the Intraday chart, the market now faces the first support around 1.1070. The euro looks as if it is a little overdone at this point in time, as the market is above the 1.11 level, and now looks as if we need a little bit of a pullback in order to find more buyers in this currency pair. Preliminary Eurozone PMIs looked mostly positive, with the Services and Composite components advancing firmly in August (53.3 and 51.2 respectively) while Manufacturing (45.6) fell slightly versus July and was a little below expectation, Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne notes.    Since the beginning of August, EUR-USD has been in a steady upward trend, and periods of stabilisation have been short-lived, Commerzbank's FX analyst Michael Pfister notes. EUR/USD rebounds after a slight drop to near 1.1130 in Thursday's European session as the flash Eurozone HCOB Composite PMI for August unexpectedly rose to 51.2, beating economists' expectations. Today's forecast beating Euro Area flash PMIs is underpinning the recent EUR/USD rally as Friday's speech by Fed chair Jerome Powell nears. The Euro (EUR) is likely to trade in a higher range of 1.1110/1.1180. Solid momentum indicates further EUR strength; it remains to be seen if the 2023 high of 1.1275 is within reach, UOB Group FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann notes. Mixed Eurozone PMI results weigh on EUR/USD, as the Dollar Index aims for a key resistance at $101.75. EUR/USD weakens below 1.1150 ahead of Eurozone/US PMI data It's certainly one step at a time for EUR/USD this week with the pair having posted four straight days of gains coming into today. At first, it was about holding a break above 1.1000. Early PMIs from Asia shows a pickup in services activity for both Australia and Japan.

Market risk appetite remains on balance to get the new trading week fired up, but Greenback pressure caught a relief as investors gear up for the long wait to key inflation figures due late this week. There's been a lot of bearish USD drivers over the past five years, particularly since Covid came into the equation. But at no point over that span of time has the weekly DXY chart finished in oversold territory – until last week. U.S. dollar gained some ground as Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index report exceeded analyst expectations. The euro is in negative territory on Monday. In the European session, EUR/USD is trading at 1.1156 at the time of writing, down 0.32% on the day. The Euro managed to meet the target of 1.1140 and advanced to test the next resistance around 1.1275. As we see on the Intraday chart, prices now face the first support around 1.1070. The euro continues to look a bit sideways in the early hours of Monday, as the US Dollar is clearly oversold. At this point, a pullback is probably healthy. EUR rose amid broad USD softness, OCBC FX strategists Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong note. EUR/USD is consolidating just under 1.12, Friday's high and the highest for EURUSD since July 2023, which was retested briefly in overnight trade, Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne notes. The EURUSD pair, often referred to by traders as the “Fiber,” is the most traded currency pair in the Forex market. It reflects the Euro's relative strength against the US Dollar, two of the world's most significant currencies. The Euro (EUR) is likely to strengthen against the US Dollar (USD) further towards 1.1225, but the significant resistance level at 1.1275 is unlikely to come into view today, UOB Group FX strategists Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann note. EUR/USD corrects slightly from 1.1200, the highest level seen in more than a year, in Monday's European session. Still, the broader outlook for the major currency pair is positive as the US Dollar (USD) remains on the backfoot as a Fed rate cut in September is fully priced in. During his speech at Jackson Hole, as reported by Reuters, the Fed Chair unexpectedly focused heavily on the US labour market. Powell stated that weaker employment prospects are unacceptable. The release of the US Core PCE price index for July this Friday will provide crucial insights into the underlying inflation trends. The core PCE index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is a key measure closely monitored by the Federal Reserve. The pair violated a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern after refusing to close below 1.1100 on Friday, increasing optimism that the rally might have more room to run. Nevertheless, it is crucial to be cautious as the RSI and stochastic oscillator display weakness in the overbought zone, indicating that selling interest persists. Bulls remain firmly in play after strong advance in past two weeks and on track for the biggest monthly gain since November 2022, as weakening dollar on strong Fed rate cut signals, continues to underpin the single currency With the leading inflation reports centered on Friday's monthly close, the markets are expected to shape their insights into September's trends and monetary policy decisions. EUR/USD Price Forecast: The first upside barrier emerges above 1.1200, eyes on the overbought condition EUR/USD extends its gains for the second session, trading around 1.1190 during the Asian session on Monday.

EUR/USD may attempt to retrace the decline from the start of the week as it preserves the advance following the Kansas City Fed Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, but data prints coming out of the Euro Area may sway the exchange rate as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is anticipated to show slowing inflation. The US Dollar continues to struggle as the Q3 trend of weakness has continued. There was another shot-in-the-arm from the Powell speech on Friday and this week started with a fresh yearly low being established in the USD. The American currency is trading near yearly lows as traders focus on dovish Fed. The Euro managed to meet the target 1.1140 and advanced further with the market facing a second resistance around 1.1275. As we see on the Intraday chart, prices now face the first support around 1.1070 and more advance will be expected with resistance around 1.1275. EUR/USD is steady as markets consolidate recent gains, Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne notes. The euro continues to see a lot of noisy trading, as we are likely to continue to see the large figures as signposts as to where we are going to go going forward. This is a market that a lot of people will be watching as to where the US Euro's (EUR) recent run higher towards 1.12 may have run its course for now and technically, there are signs to suggest that a pullback may be on the cards, OCBC FX strategists Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong note. EUR/USD has broken the inflection point and appears to be moving upward ahead of the Fed decision. EUR/USD trades in a tight range below the immediate resistance of 1.1200 in Tuesday's European session. The major currency pair consolidates as investors look for fresh cues about how much the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates this year. Boost in momentum has increased the likelihood of Euro (EUR) reaching 1.1275, UOB Group FX strategists Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann note. The big recent upside momentum in EURUSD has caught me by surprise. The pair is currently sandwiched between major resistance at 1.1278 (the July 2023 high) and support at 1.1140 (the December 2023 high). EUR/USD recovers its recent losses from the previous session, trading around 1.1170 during the Asian hours on Tuesday.

EUR/USD trimmed recent gains on Wednesday, stepping lower after clipping fresh highs for the year as broad-market anticipation of Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts in September keeps broad-market risk appetite pinned to the ceiling. The Euro is poised to snap a four-week winning streak with EUR/USD off more than 0.8% from the yearly high.

The euro fell a bit in the early hours of Wednesday, as the market is trying to come to grips with the lofty level, we currently find ourselves at.

Initially, bulls held strong, with support at prior resistance of 1.1150. The better-than-expected report provided material support to the American currency. The Euro met the target of 1.1140 and tested the support of 1.1070. As we see on the Intraday chart, if prices hold above 1.1070, another advance will be expected with resistances around 1.1140 and 1.1200.

The euro continues to see a lot of noisy behavior, as the market has seen a lot of issues, as the market will continue to look at both central banks, and the likelihood of interest rate cuts on both sides of the Atlantic. Weak August regional CPI readings from Germany alerted markets to the risk that the national data (8.00ET) will undershoot expectations (unchanged M/M and 2.1% Y/Y, down from 2.3% in July), Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne notes. The euro has extended its decline on Thursday. In the European session, EUR/USD is trading at 1.1095 at the time of writing, down 0.22% on the day. EUR/USD faces a sharp sell-off, sliding below the round-level support of 1.100 in Thursday's European session. The major currency pair extends its correction after some preliminary inflation data from Spain and six important German states showed that price pressures continued to abate in August, increasing bets of an upcoming interest-rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB). The EUR/USD pair is holding steady at around 1.1134 as markets consolidate USD positions during a lull in significant news. Investors are now keenly awaiting the release of the Core PCE inflation data, a critical metric that the Federal Reserve uses to gauge inflationary pressures and shape its interest rate policy. As the Fed aims to maintain low inflation and a strong labor market, today's US unemployment claims are in the spotlight, especially ahead of next week's non-farm payrolls data. The scale of September's potential rate cut will likely hinge on labor market conditions, impacting both the US Dollar Index and EURUSD.

Markets kicked off Monday on a notably thin volume profile, with US markets shuttered for the Labor Day holiday. U.S. Dollar Index is stuck near the 101.70 level as traders wait for catalysts. The Euro met the target of 1.1140 and tested the support of 1.1070. As we see on the Intraday chart, if prices hold above 1.1070, another advance will be expected with resistances around 1.1140 and 1.1200. The euro continues to bounce around overall, but on Monday found itself hanging about the middle of yet another consolidation area. The Americans and Canadians were away at Labor Day celebrations, so this obviously had an effect on the market as well. EUR/USD is rising after falling over 1% in the previous week. However, today's gains may be capped given that both the Federal Reserve and the ECB are expected to cut interest rates later this month. EUR/USD trades higher by about a quarter of a percent in the 1.1070s on Monday, as the Euro (EUR) strengthens against the US Dollar (USD) on the back of still-high probabilities the Federal Reserve (Fed) could implement a sharp cut in interest rates at their September meeting. This, in turn, weighs on the USD because lower interest rates make it less attractive to foreign investors, lowering capital inflows. Euro (EUR) further slipped amid softer CPI prints out of Euro-area, Germany and Spain, OCBC's FX analyst Christopher Wong notes. Rising US Treasury yields above 3.90% drive the US Dollar higher, putting pressure on EUR/USD. Traders eye key resistance levels. EURUSD is recovering somewhat after three consecutive red days from its 13-month high of 1.1200. The price is flirting with the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) and the 1.1050 support level, while the technical oscillators are showing some improvement. The EUR/USD pair trades with mild gains around 1.1055, snapping the three-day losing streak during the early European session on Monday. The dovish stance of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) undermines the Greenback and provides some support to EUR/USD. The Euro climbed higher and tested 1.1200 against the US Dollar. Recently, EUR/USD started a downside correction below 1.1150 and 1.1120 levels. EUR/USD breaks its three-day losing streak, trading around 1.1050 during the Asian session on Monday. The upside of the EUR/USD pair could be attributed to the tepid US Dollar (USD) following the dovish sentiment surrounding the US Federal Reserve (Fed).",1.10675,1.10705,1.10337,1.10675,0

EUR/USD tilted further into the low side on Tuesday, with intraday bottom bids testing into two-week lows before settling the day near 1.1050 once again. Price action remains limited as markets gear up for one last US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) print this week, but a flop in US ISM Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) figures reignited fears of an impending recession. In this webinar we take an in-depth look at the technical trade levels for the US Dollar (DXY), 10yr Treasury Yields, Euro (EUR/USD), British Pound (GBP/USD), Australian Dollar (AUD/USD), Canadian Dollar (USD/CAD), Japanese Yen (USD/JPY), Swiss Franc (USD/CHF), Gold (XAU/USD), CAD/CHF, Crude Oil (WTI), S&P 500 (SPX500), Nasdaq (NDX) and the Dow Jones (DJI). These are the levels that matter on the technical charts heading into the weekly open. U.S. Dollar Index is moving higher as traders ignore the pullback in Treasury yields. The Euro (EUR) is drifting lower, in line with the broader recovery in the US Dollar (USD), Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne notes. The Euro tested of the Intraday support level 1.1040 last Friday. As we see on the chart, the market is facing supports around 1.1040 and 1.0970-90. The euro drifted a bit lower in the early hours of Tuesday, as the market continues to go back and forth between big figures. By doing so, it looks like we are still in that same consolidation zone that we have been in for two years. The Euro (EUR) traded little changed overnight. Last seen at 1.1040 levels, OCBC FX strategists Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong note. EUR/USD appreciated by 0.2% to 1.1072, brushing aside the victory of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the eastern state of Thuringia, but now it's back below 1.1048 at 1.1035, DBS Senior FX Strategist Philip Wee notes. As we enter September, both the Fed rate cut, and ECB rate cut are looming on the horizon. The EURUSD is entering the month in a corrective mode as the US Dollar index respects the December 2023 support. EUR/USD falls back after failing to extend recovery above the immediate resistance of 1.1080 in Tuesday's European session. The major currency pair drops as the US Dollar (USD) clings to gains to near an almost two-week high as the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback's value against six major currencies, trades close to 101.80. The forex market was relatively quiet during the Asian trading session, with only minor changes seen across currencies. There was a slight dip in commodity currencies due to weaker-than-expected manufacturing data from China, though this was somewhat balanced by better results from the Caixin PMI report. ISM manufacturing data is released today for August, and I'm intrigued to see if we see a further deterioration in the sector. If so, it could bolster EUR/USD for a cheeky run for 1.11, even if the weekly timeframe looks like it can still move lower beyond any such bounce.",1.10489,1.1094,1.10408,1.10489,1

Despite the topside tilt to price action in the midweek, the pair remains hobbled below the 1.1100 handle. The weaker-than-expected job market data put pressure on the American currency. Keep in mind, EUR/USD reversed ahead of the 2023 high (1.1276) to pull the Relative Strength Index (RSI) back from overbought territory, and the recent weakness in the exchange rate may persist as the bullish momentum abates. The Euro tested of the Intraday support level 1.1040 last Friday. As we see on the chart, the market is facing supports around 1.1040 and 1.0970-90. The Wednesday session looks like it will bring very little in the way of momentum when it comes to the EUR/USD pair, as the market is simply caught between two major large round figures. This is the pattern that the market has been following for some time, and I think The Euro (EUR) is little changed on the session, Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne notes. In the first half of Wednesday's session, we have seen a slight recovery in global indices and futures from their overnight lows, providing a calmer backdrop in the FX space after currency volatility rose on Tuesday as US markets resumed trading after the extended Labor Day weekend. It was a tech driven sell-off on Wall Street that triggered a classic risk-off trade in FX markets, as safe-haven currencies such as the JPY, CHF and USD all gained ground against high-betas such as the AUD and NZD, as well as the GBP and EUR. The Euro (EUR) traded a touch softer, but range remains subdued, OCBC FX strategists Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong note.

Markets are looking for further signs that the Federal Reserve (Fed) is on pace to deliver an initial rate trim and kick off a rate cutting cycle in September, but US data will need to continue softening to keep rate cut hopes on the high side. Forex traders bet on dovish Fed, which is bearish for the American currency. Euro snapped a four-week winning streak last week with EUR/USD turning from fresh yearly highs. The focus is on this correction within the broader uptrend with the bulls vulnerable near-term while below the last week's highs. The Euro rebounded after testing the support level of 1.1040 in the last few days. As we see on the chart, the market still facing supports around 1.1040 and 1.0970-90 with resistances at 1.1140 and 1.1200. The euro continues to see a bit of sideways action, perhaps with a slight upwards pressure to it. Ultimately, this is a market that continues to see the large, round, psychological levels as areas that are acting like magnets for price. German Factory Orders rose 2.9% in July—a surprising gain which followed an upwardly revised rise of 4.6% for June. The EUR/USD pair remained stable around 1.1077 on Thursday morning, following steady growth in the previous session but still confined within a sideways channel. Investors are holding back and conserving their energy in anticipation of crucial employment data from the United States, which begins with today's ADP private sector jobs report. The EURUSD trading pair has built an upward momentum signaling an impending upward breakout. Has the dollar come to the end of the road? The Euro (EUR) was a touch firmer amid broad USD softness overnight, OCBC FX strategists Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong note. On the hourly chart of EUR/USD at FXOpen, the pair started a fresh decline from the 1.1200 zone. The Euro declined below the 1.1150 support zone to enter a bearish zone against the US Dollar. EUR/USD holds onto Wednesday's recovery slightly below the round-level resistance of 1.1100 in Thursday's European session. The major currency pair bounced back sharply on Wednesday after the release of the weaker-than-projected United States (US) JOLTS Job Openings data for July boosted market expectations for the Federal Reserve (Fed) to begin the long-awaited policy-easing cycle aggressively. With so much attention on US employment data this week, I feel compelled to remind all that today's ISM services report could pack a punch of its own. And that we are approaching today's report under similar circumstances to the last: Traders are concerned that the US could be headed for a recession following weaker employment and ISM manufacturing reports. EUR/USD inches lower to near 1.1070 during the Asian session on Thursday.

EUR/USD has continued to coil lower even after a two-and-a-half-day rally last week. The pair had started to show tendencies of bearish action in late-August, with both lower-lows and lower-highs appearing on the four-hour chart. The American currency is moving higher amid lack of strong catalysts. The EUR/USD lost a chunk of its weekly gains on Friday and continued to fall in the first half of Monday's session. The downside should be limited from here on, however, with investors likely to proceed with caution ahead of US CPI inflation data on Wednesday and a rate decision by the European Central Bank a day later. Reflecting the movements in bond yields, there were a lot of gyrations in EUR/USD on Friday firstly on the back of the US payrolls report and then in response to the remarks of Fed speakers, Rabobank's Senior FX Strategist Jane Foley notes. The Euro rebounded last week to test the first resistance 1.1140. As we see on the chart, the market hit the 1.1040 support and still has a chance for another rebound toward the 1.1200 zone. The euro continues to see a lot of noisy behavior, and at this point in time, it is likely that we will see this pair just simply going back and forth – trying to determine which central bank is going to be more aggressive about cutting going forward. EUR/USD is drifting a little lower in quiet trade at the start of the week, Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne notes. Room for EUR to retest the 1.1025 level; the chance of a sustained break below this level is not high at this time, UOB Group FX strategists Quek Ser Leang and Alvin Liew note. EUR/USD extends its downside below 1.1050 in Monday's European session. The major currency pair declines as the US Dollar (USD) strengthens after mixed cues over current labor market health from Friday's United States (US) Nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report for August, which diminished market expectations for the Federal Reserve (Fed) to reduce interest rates aggressively this month. Several important economic data releases and events may affect market sentiment in the next few days, following a gloomy week.

EUR/USD attempts to recoup losses from the previous session, trading near 1.1090 during Monday's Asian session.

However, the market is also looking at a lot of questions when it comes to both central banks and how many interest rate cuts are coming from each one.

EURUSD is pressuring pivotal support at 1.1040 (Fibo 38.2% of 1.0781/1.1200 bull-leg), after facing several rejections at this level recently. The Euro (EUR) could break 1.1025; the next support at 1.0995 could be out of reach for now.

EUR/USD struggles to gain ground near its weekly low of 1.1030 in Tuesday's European session. The major currency pair remains under pressure as investors turn cautious ahead of the United States (US) Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for August and the European Central Bank's interest rate policy, which will be published on Wednesday and announced on Thursday, respectively. The Euro remained on the defensive on Monday amid an on-going lack of confidence in the Euro-Zone economy and strong expectations of a further ECB interest rate cut this week. The Pound to Euro (GBP/EUR) exchange rate recovered from 10-day lows at 1.1835 to trade around 1.1850 as equity markets attempted to recover.    The Pound (GBP) is edged lower on Monday amid a global atmosphere of cautious trading.

The Euro is poised to snap a four-day losing streak with EUR/USD trading into the objective 2024 yearly open on heels of today's ECB rate decision. Price has plunged nearly 1.8% off the yearly highs with a reversal off uptrend resistance now searching for support. Euro made a modest recovery following ECB's decision to cut deposit rate by 25bps, a move widely anticipated by the markets. The rate cut, decided unanimously, brings the deposit rate to 3.75%. The euro has done very little over the last couple of days as we continue to hang around the crucial 1.10 level. This is obviously a large, round, psychologically significant figure that will attract quite a bit of attention from traders. Today, September 12, 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to cut interest rates by 60 basis points, marking a significant adjustment in its monetary policy.

ECB policy decision is due today (815pm SG time) followed by Lagarde's press conference (845pm SGT). Softer CPI prints out of Euro-area, Germany and Spain and softer mfg PMI readings added to expectation that ECB should be on course to lower rate again, OCBC's FX analysts Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong note.

With the ECB's rate decision looming, will the US Dollar maintain its strength? Explore potential impacts on EUR/USD and GBP/USD this week. Forex traders are cautious ahead of the ECB Interest Rate Decision. The ECB's data-driven, meeting-by-meeting approach is creating a favorable environment for a rate cut in September.

Spot prices currently trade around the 1.1160 area, nearly unchanged for the day, as traders keenly await the release of the flash German consumer inflation figures and the Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell's speech for some fresh impetus.

Strong job market data and rising geopolitical tensions provided support to the American currency. US Dollar gains as Fed signals measured rate cuts. EUR/USD drops amid low German inflation, with ECB rate cut speculation weighing on the euro. Eurozone Manufacturing PMI was revised up in September to 45.0 (from 44.8) after Spain reported a solid gain and German and French data were nudged up marginally from preliminary reports, Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne notes. The euro continues to see a lot of noisy behavior, as the markets have reacted to CPI numbers in the European Union coming in at 1.8% year over year. This is below the 2% target for the ECB, which could keep monetary policy loose. → In the second half of September, bullish sentiment dominated, resulting in the formation of an ascending channel (shown in blue). However, near the key resistance at 1.1200 (drawn from the August peak), the bullish momentum faded, and the price entered a range between 1.1200 and 1.1122. EUR/USD slides below the round-level support of 1.1100 in Tuesday's European session. The major currency pair weakens due to further deceleration in the preliminary annual Eurozone headline Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) below the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of 2%, which has boosted market speculation for the ECB cutting interest rates again in October.

The EUR/USD pair struggles to gain any meaningful traction following the previous day's pullback from the vicinity of the 14-month peak – levels just above the 1.1200 mark and oscillates in a narrow band during the Asian session on Tuesday. Spot prices currently trade around the 1.1135-1.1140 area, nearly unchanged for the day as traders keenly await the release of the Eurozone inflation data before placing directional bets. The pair tried to seek a firm break above 1.1200 three times in September but failed, similar to the previous and first attempt this year back in August. The figure level remains a stubborn point where sellers are leaning on in keeping price action lower for now.",1.10639,1.10822,1.10341,1.10639,0
