Daily Market Outlook, May 20, 2024Munnelly’s Macro Minute…“Iranian President’s Reported Death Reignites Middle East Concerns ”Asian equity markets are mostly higher to start the week, potentially lifted by hopes that Chinese authorities will soon announce additional economic stimulus. Although Chinese banks kept their long-term prime interest rates unchanged today, speculation is growing that an official signal of easier monetary policy could come in the next few weeks. Meanwhile, reports of the Iranian President&#039;s death in a helicopter crash today may lead to increased market speculation about Middle East stability.The upcoming week in the U.S. is divided between Federal Reserve speakers early on and data releases later. FOMC members such as John Williams, Christopher Waller, Raphael Bostic, and Thomas Barkin are scheduled to speak, offering varying perspectives on the recent dip in U.S. CPI. The overall consensus suggests that the Fed remains cautious and reliant on data for future policy decisions. Additionally, the FOMC minutes for the April 30-May 1 meeting will be released, along with S&amp;P flash manufacturing and services PMIs, new home sales, durable goods, and University of Michigan consumer sentiment data.In China, it is anticipated that one-year and five-year loan prime rates will remain unchanged despite sluggish loans and credit data.In Japan, a busy week for data includes machinery orders, trade figures, flash PMIs, and nationwide April CPI. There are no scheduled events from the Bank of Japan.The Eurozone&#039;s data calendar includes trade figures, flash PMIs, consumer confidence data, and a video message from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.UK investors will be watching Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey’s speech, followed by UK data releases, particularly Wednesday&#039;s inflation report, which is expected to show a significant decrease in annual headline CPI inflation. Core inflation is also anticipated to decrease but remain higher than the headline rate.Overnight Newswire Updates of NoteAsking Prices For UK Homes Hit Record High, Rightmove SaysChina’s Benchmark Lending Rates Held Steady This MonthRBNZ Shadow Board Recommends OCR Stay At 5.5% At May DecisionJapan’s 10-Year Bond Yield Hits Decade-High Amid BoJ Policy BetsAsian Stocks Rise As Copper, Gold Climb To New RecordsBHP Debates Improved Anglo Bid As Time Runs Out In Takeover SagaJapan And ASEAN To Craft Auto Strategy To Counter China&#039;s EVsIsrael War Cabinet Member Sets Ultimatum, Threatens To Quit&quot;No Survivors&quot; Found At Crash Site Of Helicopter Carrying Iran&#039;s President(Sourced from Bloomberg, Reuters and other reliable financial news outlets)FX Options Expiries For 10am New York Cut(1BLN+ represent larger expiries, more magnetic when trading within daily ATR)EUR/USD: 1.0850-55 (1.7BLN), 1.0875 (1.2BLN), 1.0885-1.0900 (2.6BLN)USD/CHF: 0.9050 (610M), 0.9080 (381M)GBP/USD: 1.2600-10 (464M), 1.2625 (259M), 1.2645 (458M), 1.2725 (230M)AUD/USD: 0.6590-0.6605 (1.5BLN), 0.6705-10 (506M), 0.6780 (1.1BLN)NZD/USD: 0.6100 (1.3BLN), 0.6145-50 (528M)USD/CAD: 1.3535 (721M), 1.3600 (335M), 1.3730 (734M)EUR/NOK: 11.61 (568M), 11.775 (322M)USD/JPY: 155.00 (789M), 156.00 (596M), 156.45-50 (1.4BLN), 157.00 (820M)There is limited tier one data expected to impact the EUR/USD exchange rate this week.

On Friday evening GBPUSD climbed to a new weekly high at 1.27118 level. EURUSD chart analysis EURUSD retreated to support at the 1.08350 level on Friday before the US session started. After that, the dollar began to weaken again and the euro took advantage of that by climbing up to the 1.08800 level. During this morning&#8217;s Asian trading session, we saw movement in the 1.08700-1.08800 range. We will probably try to stabilize at 1.08700 before continuing with further growth. Potential higher targets are 1.08900 and 1.09000 levels. We need a negative consolidation and pullback below the EMA50 moving average and the 1.08650 level for a bearish option. In this way, we move to the bearish side and can expect to start looking for new support. Potential lower targets are 1.08500 and 1.08400, Friday&#8217;s low. EMA200 moving average is in the zone of 1.08200 levels. GBPUSD chart analysis On Friday evening GBPUSD climbed to a new weekly high at 1.27118 level. During the Asian trading session, the pound tried to break above but ended without success. With the start of the EU session, the pound weakens, and the pair retreats to the 1.26890 level. The pressure is now on the bearish side, and we can expect a pullback to be initiated. Potential lower targets are 1.26700 and 1.26600 levels. We could get the first stronger support in the EMA50 moving average in the zone of 1.26750 levels. If we manage to go back up to the 1.27000 level, GBPUSD will return above the daily open price. With this, we climb to the positive side and hope for further recovery to the bullish side. Potential higher targets are 1.27200 and 1.27400 levels.",1.08742,1.08746,1.08713,1.08722,0
